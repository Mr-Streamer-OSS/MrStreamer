// Which of the provider's streams are one channel, and which of them to play. Panels list a channel
// once per quality ("VRT 1 FHD", "VRT 1 HD", "VRT 1 SD"), with backups ("FHD²") and sometimes in a
// category of their own ("BE | 4K"). Streams join only when they are surely the same channel:
//   - Their titles agree once quality markers are gone, case and accents aside but not spaces or
//     symbols: "Canal+" is not "Canal", nor "VRT1" "VRT 1".
//   - Their regions agree, and their languages: "BE - FR | RTBF La Une" stays apart from "BE |
//     RTBF La Une".
//   - Their categories hold the same, quality words aside: "BE | VLAANDEREN" and "BE | VLAANDEREN
//     HD" do, "CA | FRENCH" and "CA | ENGLISH" don't. A stream in a category named only for a
//     quality joins the title's streams when they form one group, and stays with its kind otherwise.
//   - Their trusted guide ids don't disagree, however each is spelt: "vtm.be" is "vtm BE". A shared
//     guide id joins nothing by itself: panels file unrelated channels under one (see
//     ./guide-ids.ts).
// Anything less certain stays apart, as the provider lists it.
