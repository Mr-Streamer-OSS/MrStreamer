// The viewing record service: favourites, watch history, how far movies and episodes got and the
// episodes marked by hand, as events per account. Commands carry an id, so sending one again
// changes nothing more; the store appends a command's events and the state they add up to in one
// transaction, and the service tells the UI after the commit.
//
// Every channel and title a call names says which subscription it belongs to, and so does every
// one it answers with. The record keeps them per account by the provider's own ids, under the key
// the app gives a saved subscription. A call that names a subscription that isn't saved reads and
// changes nothing: what finishes after its subscription went never lands in another account's
// record.
//
// The lists it answers with are every saved subscription's at once: the favourites in the order
// they were starred, whichever subscription each is from, the channels watched by when they were
// watched, and Continue watching by when each title played. Each entry stays in its own account's
// record, so removing a subscription takes its entries out of the lists and nothing else, and
// what another build wrote for one account still reads as it wrote it.
//
// An episode's mark is kept by its series and its numbers, apart from how far any file played
// (see ./marks.ts and ./episodes.ts). Which series that is, and which versions of it a
// subscription lists, the lists say when the mark is made and each time it is read: the UI names
// a version and never says what it belongs to. Where a marked series goes on is worked out each
// time the record is read, from how it stands then and the episodes the series listed when it
// was last marked, so it follows what a play saves afterwards and asks no provider. When the
// app reads those episodes again for its own ends, it tells the record what they are now.
//
// The app supplies five ports: which subscriptions are saved, the store, the lists kept in
// preferences.json before the record, which the first start imports once, the catalogues'
// channels, and what the lists and a series' details say of a series. The record keeps the
// provider's stream ids, as builds before channels with several
// streams did, and shows them by channel: a list holding two streams of one channel shows it once,
// by the channel's id. Nothing stored is rewritten, so those builds still read every list. A new
// order of the favourites is no exception: it is the same favourites, removed and added again.
