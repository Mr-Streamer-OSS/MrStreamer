// Versions: the app's package.json (apps/desktop/package.json) on main holds the newest stable
// release (0.0.0 before the first). Nightlies preview the next patch, 0.0.2-nightly.20261002.14,
// counting from that package.json or the
// newest stable release, whichever is newer, so a stable release that main has not recorded yet
// never makes later nightlies sort below it. A stable release rebuilds the commit of the tested
// nightly it is given, as the version that nightly previewed unless another is given. A nightly
// from before the newest stable release qualifies only when it holds that release's commit, such
// as the nightly a stable run publishes first, and needs a version given. When main
// has commits no published nightly holds, the stable run publishes a nightly of main first, so
// Nightly users have every change before Stable users get any of it.
//
// Reads GitHub with gh, prints the plan as GitHub Actions outputs, and fails with the reason when
// a release is refused. Release jobs run it with plain node before installing packages, so it
// imports only node: modules and dependency-free files, by relative path rather than package name.
