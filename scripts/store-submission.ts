// The Microsoft side of a Store submission, through Microsoft's Store submission API: what the
// Store holds, sending a checked package, and reading what Microsoft did with it.
// scripts/store-release.ts is the GitHub side; docs/maintainers/microsoft-store.md describes both.
//
//   node scripts/store-submission.ts preflight [--release <file> [--draft <id> [--draft-metadata-sha256 <hex>]]]
//   node scripts/store-submission.ts submit --release <file> [--draft <id> --draft-metadata-sha256 <hex>]
//   node scripts/store-submission.ts status --release <file>
//
// The credential comes from the environment: STORE_TENANT_ID, STORE_CLIENT_ID and
// STORE_CLIENT_SECRET, with STORE_CLIENT_SECRET_EXPIRES for the day the key ends.
//
// preflight and status only read. submit follows these rules:
//
// - A new submission is Microsoft's copy of the published one. It goes back as it came, fields
//   this script doesn't know included, with two changes: the package, and "What's new". The
//   description, screenshots, trailers, price and markets stay as they are.
// - A listing has to carry its package's name. With a package named STORE_NAME, every listing
//   titled otherwise gets that name as its title, which happens once. A package built before
//   that name changes no title.
// - It never sets who sees the app or when it is published. The published submission must be
//   Public and publish as soon as it is certified (Immediate), or nothing is created.
// - A package is uploaded under a name that carries the release's commit and the file's checksum.
//   That name is how a later run finds its own submission, so repeating a run adds nothing.
// - The Store takes one submission at a time. One that doesn't hold this release's package stops
//   the run, whoever made it, and so does a published package this one doesn't sort after.
//   Nothing is ever deleted, and a submission Microsoft is checking is never changed.
// - A release goes into a draft someone made in Partner Center only when the run names it, with
//   --draft, and never into a new submission then. submit also takes the draft's fingerprint, which
//   a preflight with the draft prints: the SHA-256 of all the draft holds that a release leaves
//   alone. The draft must be the one named, still have that fingerprint and hold no package but
//   the published ones and this release's. It is read again once the release is in it and once
//   the package is uploaded, and nothing is uploaded or committed unless the rest is as it was.
// - In such a draft the package's name also carries the draft's ID and the start of that
//   fingerprint. Only a run that names both looks for that name, so a release's own run and a
//   plain submit stop at the draft however far an earlier run got with it.
// - Only requests that change nothing by being repeated are sent again. When creating or
//   committing gets no clear answer, the script reads what happened instead of asking twice.
// - Nothing of a token, the key or an upload address is printed, and of Microsoft's answers only
//   what this script knows the shape of.
//
// The Store job runs it with plain node and installs no packages, so it imports only node: modules
// and dependency-free files, by relative path.
