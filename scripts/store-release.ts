// The GitHub side of a Microsoft Store submission: whether the Store workflow may run, which
// release it is for, and whether the package a release run kept is that release's.
// scripts/store-submission.ts is the Microsoft side; docs/maintainers/microsoft-store.md describes
// both.
//
//   node scripts/store-release.ts gate --action <preflight|status|submit> --ref <ref> [--enabled <value>] [--release-run]
//   node scripts/store-release.ts release --version <0.0.5> --out <file> [--sha <commit>] [--run <id>] [--package]
//   node scripts/store-release.ts verify --release <file> --dir <folder> [--sha256 <checksum>]
//
// - gate: submitting needs the repository variable STORE_AUTOMATION_ENABLED to be "true", and every
//   action needs the microsoft-store environment to exist for main alone. It runs before any job
//   names that environment, because GitHub creates a missing one, unprotected, for the first job
//   that does.
// - release: the version must be a published stable release whose tag is on main. With --package
//   it also names the release run whose artifact holds the package: the one given, or the newest
//   that still has it.
// - verify: the downloaded package must be that release's: its record, its checksum, and the
//   identity and version in its own manifest. It adds the package to the file release wrote.
//
// Reads GitHub with gh, prints GitHub Actions outputs, and fails with the reason. The Store job
// runs it with plain node and installs no packages, so it imports only node: modules and
// dependency-free files, by relative path.
