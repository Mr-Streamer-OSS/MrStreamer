// The site's download links: where each installer of the current stable release is, and how
// the page shows it. README.md, Downloads, has the whole account.
//
// - index.html is written with every installer link on the Releases page and no version: what
//   the page says when nothing is known.
// - The build takes the highest stable version from fresh GitHub release history, falling back
//   to the update feed if history is unavailable. It asks GitHub whether each installer answers
//   (`verifiedDownloads`) and writes the ones that do into the page (`writeDownloads`).
// - The open page reads the feed once and shows the installers it lists (`listedDownloads`,
//   `showDownloads`), so a release published after the build still reaches the page.
//
// A link is never guessed. Its address is this repository's release folder, a version shaped
// like a stable one and a file name from INSTALLERS, and it is written only after GitHub
// answered for that file or the feed listed it. Nothing else from the feed reaches the page.
