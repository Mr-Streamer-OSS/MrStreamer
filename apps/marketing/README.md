# The website

Static pages for `https://mrstreamer.app`, built with Vite from HTML, CSS, TypeScript and the repository's Markdown. The homepage's pictures are captures of the real app, kept in `docs/assets` and described in [marketing artwork](../../docs/contributing/marketing-artwork.md).

`public/generated/`, `dist/` and `.vercel/` are built and stay out of git.

## Run it

From the repository root, with Node 24 and pnpm 11:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev:marketing       # the site with live reload, on http://localhost:5173
pnpm build:marketing     # pictures, pages and the Vercel package
pnpm preview:marketing   # the built site, on http://localhost:4173
```

`pnpm build:marketing` checks every listed page's metadata, sitemap entry, scripts, styles and referenced assets. It checks that every Markdown source's headings reached its page and that internal links and fragments exist. It also checks installer URLs and the homepage's system-selection script and structured data. `scripts/package-vercel.ts` lists the checks. The build reads paginated GitHub releases, selects the highest complete stable release and verifies four installers. The update feed is a fallback when history is unavailable. Network failure leaves truthful GitHub links and does not fail the build. The existing workflow token authenticates the release-history request in CI; a local build works anonymously when neither `GH_TOKEN` nor `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available. Tokens are never written to HTML or logged.

`pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm knip` and `pnpm fmt:check` cover this folder with the rest of the repository.

## Addresses

Both local servers and Vercel answer the same addresses, with or without a query:

| Address                                                                                                                       | Answers                                                               |

| `/docs/subscriptions`, `/docs/live-tv`, `/docs/movies-and-series`, `/docs/updates`, `/docs/playback`, `/docs/troubleshooting` | The corresponding `docs/user/<slug>.md`                               |
| `/about`                                                                                                                      | Product facts from `docs/about.md`, with the verified stable version  |
| `/security`                                                                                                                   | Login storage, signing and checksums from `docs/security.md`          |
| `/download`                                                                                                                   | Current stable installers, requirements, checksums, notes and sources |
| `/releases`                                                                                                                   | Every published stable release and its date and notes, newest first   |
| Public files such as `/robots.txt` or `/sitemap.xml`                                                                          | The file                                                              |
| Any other address, including HTML aliases such as `/404.html`                                                                 | The 404 page, with status 404                                         |

Every document address also accepts a trailing slash. `scripts/pages.ts` is the address registry used by both local servers and Vercel packaging. Update `public/sitemap.xml` when adding a page; the build checks it against that registry.

Vercel alone answers `/_vercel/insights/`, for [website analytics](#website-analytics).

## Change it

- Keep the words true and few. Every claim on the page comes from the README or the docs. The app's limits are in [what plays](../../docs/user/playback.md).
- True black, white text, minimal copy. Screenshots describe the app, so a feature is its name and one sentence beside its window.
- The page order is the bar, the hero, the Home window, the three features, What you need, Questions, Downloads, the footer. The hero has the page's one button. The bar links Downloads as text.
- The homepage title and description name the product and systems. Its single h1 names Mr. Streamer above the existing slogan. Structured data describes `SoftwareApplication` and `SoftwareSourceCode`, with the alternate product name, publisher, repository and four screenshots. `softwareVersion` comes only from a stable release with a verified installer. There are no invented ratings or reviews. Every document has its own metadata, canonical address and sitemap entry. Add no page for a single system or search phrase.
- Nothing moves by itself, and every animation runs once and ends:
  - As the page opens, the bar drops in, the headline and lead rise, the one button pops, its line rises and the Home window stands up, or only rises while the layout is stacked. This is CSS alone, so it runs without JavaScript.
  - As a part scrolls into view, a feature's text slides in from the page's edge while a black panel wipes off its window. What you need and each question rise in, and each download row slides in from the left, questions and rows one after another. What is on screen when the page opens stays as it is.
  - As the page scrolls, the Home window tips upright. Upright, it has no transform left.
  - The button lifts 2 px under the pointer or the keyboard's focus.

  Only `transform` and `opacity` change. `main.ts` adds `revealed` to a part once and takes it off when its animation ends or is dropped, so no class, panel or layer stays behind. Once the page is open, the script works only after a scroll, a resize or a changed preference. With reduced motion nothing moves, also when the preference changes while the page is open. Nothing waits hidden for the script. An animation only starts from hidden, and a part that never animates is in place.

- New pictures come from new captures. Follow the [artwork recipe](../../docs/contributing/marketing-artwork.md). A phone shows a part of each window, set in `prepare-assets.ts`, with its size repeated in `index.html`.
- Markdown remains the source for privacy, the six guides, about and security. The site builds the checked-out `main`, rather than copying guides from a stable tag. Coordinate new feature documentation with its release. Relative guide links become public page links, retaining fragments. Documents that are not public pages link to GitHub, never to a nonexistent site route. Scripts are not needed to read any document. Merging a change to any rendered Markdown source starts the marketing publication workflow.

## Downloads

The hero offers one download for the visitor's system and keeps its existing button and per-system notes. The homepage Downloads section has a short line of installer links and points to `/download`, which holds the full rows and requirements.

### One button

`src/system.ts` names the visitor's system from the browser's user agent, its touch points and, in Chromium, the platform it reports. The build writes that function's own text into the head of `index.html`, where it runs before the page paints and sets `data-os` on `<html>`. `styles.css` shows the button and line that match, so the button never swaps after it shows.

| Visitor                                  | Button                  | Goes to                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Windows                                  | Microsoft's Store badge | The Store listing      |
| Mac                                      | Download for Mac        | The DMG                |
| Linux on a computer                      | Download for Linux      | The AppImage           |
| Anyone else, and anyone with scripts off | Downloads               | The list at the bottom |

Anyone else is a phone, a tablet, an iPad asking for the desktop site, ChromeOS, a console, a television, another Unix, or a browser whose reported platform and user agent disagree. A computer's Linux browser writes X11 or Wayland beside Linux in its user agent, and a television's doesn't. The setup .exe and the .deb are never in the hero.

The script knows the system and not the processor. An Intel Mac gets the Mac button, so the line under each button names the hardware its file needs and links the list. It asks the browser for no detailed hints, stores nothing and sends nothing.

### Which release the links point at

`index.html` is written with every installer link on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer/releases/latest), a label that says so, and no version. That is what the page shows when nothing is known. The homepage and `/download` share two steps that point links at files, both in `src/downloads.ts`:

1. **The build** reads the complete published stable release history from GitHub and uses the update feed's selection rule for the highest version with all three update manifests. A withdrawn release remains in the history with its sources but is not offered for download. If the history is unavailable, the validated [update feed](../../docs/maintainers/releasing.md#update-feed) is the fallback. A query string does not reliably bypass GitHub Pages' cache. It then asks GitHub for each of the four installers by its address, one HEAD request each. It writes the ones GitHub answers for into both pages, with a version beside known hero installers and in the download page's title and release line. The same verified version reaches the about page and homepage structured data. With no verified installer, all general version claims are omitted and the download title is versionless. The built pages link files without scripts.
2. **The open page** requests the feed once, with no retry and no polling. The feed lists the installers its stable release carries. A feed generated before the build verified release eligibility is ignored when it names a different release, so a cached old feed cannot undo a publication or withdrawal. This also applies when no eligible stable release remains. A feed naming the selected release can fill installer links that failed their build-time check. Home, download and about show a current feed's release, including the download title, release notes, checksums and source links and homepage structured data. A stable release reaches visitors this way without a new build of the site, once the release workflow has published the feed and GitHub's ten-minute cache of it has passed.

A recorded stable promotion on `main` starts **Marketing deploy** through `workflow_run`. Its gate reads GitHub's job records and requires the stable-only **Record the stable version on main** job to have succeeded. A later Store upload failure does not undo publication or prevent the rebuild. Scheduled runs, nightlies, dry runs, forks and non-main runs do not pass. This avoids relying on a release event that `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger. Deployment still requires `MARKETING_DEPLOY_ENABLED`, the protected `marketing-production` environment and the existing main/revision checks. The workflow builds current `main`, with no checkout or artifact execution from the triggering run. A manual **Marketing deploy** from `main` also rebuilds the site.

| When                                                    | The page links                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The build and the feed name the same release            | That release's files                                                                               |
| A stable release came out after the build               | With scripts, the new release. Without, the one the build found, whose files stay on GitHub        |
| The build couldn't read history or the feed             | The Releases page, until the open page reads the feed. The build prints a warning and still passes |
| The release lacks an installer, or GitHub didn't answer | The Releases page for that installer, files for the others                                         |
| The visitor's browser can't reach the feed              | What the build wrote                                                                               |
| The feed was written before feeds listed installers     | What the build wrote                                                                               |
| The feed names a nightly, or files outside this project | The open page keeps what the build wrote. A build links the Releases page                          |
| A stable release was withdrawn and the feed moved back  | A fresh build excludes it; scripts accept a newer feed that names its replacement                  |

A link is never guessed and never taken from the feed. Its address is this repository's release folder, a version shaped like a stable one, and a file name from `INSTALLERS` in `downloads.ts`, which follow `artifactName` in `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml`. Rename an installer there and the page links the Releases page for it until `INSTALLERS` follows. The version shows only beside a button whose file is linked.

The homepage, download and about pages request the feed once to keep their displayed release consistent. The request goes to GitHub Pages. The [privacy policy](../../docs/privacy.md#the-website) says what GitHub receives.

### Release history

`/releases` requests the public GitHub Releases API at build time, 100 releases per page until it reaches the end. It excludes drafts, prereleases and non-stable tags, and sorts by the actual publication dates. Notes come directly from GitHub and render openly as Markdown, with HTML and unsafe URLs escaped or removed. Remote images become links so notes do not silently load third-party images.

The entire history request has a 20-second deadline and a 100-page limit. An HTTP error, malformed response, timeout or failure of a later page discards the partial history. The page then says history is unavailable here and links to GitHub Releases. It never claims a partial list is complete and never copies mock notes or dates. A later publish reads the complete history again without hand edits.

### The badge and the marks

`public/icons/` holds three files, served from the site so the page asks no one else for them. Each loads lazily, so only the visitor whose button shows it fetches it. With scripts off a browser fetches all three.

| File                  | From                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `microsoft-store.svg` | Microsoft's light Store badge, `https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20light.svg`, byte for byte, 161 by 44  |
| `apple.svg`           | The Apple logo as [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) 15.22.0 draws it, CC0 1.0. A trademark of Apple Inc. |
| `linux.svg`           | Tux as Simple Icons 15.22.0 draws it, CC0 1.0. Larry Ewing drew Tux. Linux is a trademark of Linus Torvalds    |

Keep the badge as Microsoft publishes it: no new colour, crop or redrawing, and its own proportions. There is no Mac App Store listing, so the Mac and Linux buttons are plain buttons with the system's mark and never a store badge.

## Website analytics

The production build loads Vercel Web Analytics for page views. Local development does not load it. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel project's Analytics tab before deploying; the project currently has it enabled. The desktop app has no analytics. The [privacy policy](../../docs/privacy.md#the-website) describes website data collection.

The pages load the script from `/_vercel/insights/script.js` and send page views to `/_vercel/insights/view`. Vercel adds both to a deployment in its build step. A prebuilt package of static files skips that step unless it arrives as an archive, so every deployment here uses `--archive=tgz`. Without the flag the site looks the same, the script answers 404 and nothing is counted.

To check a deployment, ask for the script. It answers JavaScript, and the 404 page when the routes are missing:

```sh
curl -sI https://mrstreamer.app/_vercel/insights/script.js | grep -i content-type   # application/javascript
```

`pnpm preview:marketing` answers that address with the 404 page, as it is not Vercel.

## How it gets published

`.github/workflows/marketing-deploy.yml` publishes the page from GitHub Actions. Vercel only serves it.

1. A push to `main` changing site inputs, a recorded stable promotion on `main`, or a manual run from `main` starts a build. The trigger gate rejects nightlies and dry runs.
2. The build job has no owner secrets. It uses the workflow's read-only GitHub token for release history, builds `main`, checks the package and hands over `.vercel/output` alone.
3. The publish job holds the Vercel token. It checks out nothing and runs the pinned Vercel CLI on that package: `vercel deploy --prebuilt --archive=tgz --prod`.

Runs queue without replacing pending publications and none is cancelled halfway, using the same `queue: max` policy as the release workflow. This also prevents a nightly completion that the trigger gate rejects from displacing a pending site publication. A run that waited builds the newest `main`. Before it publishes, a run asks git whether `main` has changed the website since its build. If it has, the run leaves publishing to the run that change started. If git can't tell, the run fails and publishes nothing.

Publishing is off until you turn it on. Until then a run builds, says publishing is off, and stops. Every pull request also builds the page in `.github/workflows/marketing.yml`, without secrets.

## Set it up, once

These steps need the owner's accounts. Nothing here costs money. Stop if a step asks for a paid plan.

### 1. Check that the free plan fits

Vercel's Hobby plan is for personal, non-commercial use. Its [fair use guidelines](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines#commercial-usage) count a site as commercial when it takes payment, sells something or shows ads, and say that asking for donations doesn't count. The page does none of those. If that changes, or you are unsure, ask Vercel before you rely on Hobby.

### 2. Create the Vercel project

Use the CLI. The dashboard's New Project flow starts from a Git repository, which this project must not have.

```sh
npx --yes vercel@62.2.0 login
npx --yes vercel@62.2.0 project add mrstreamer-marketing
npx --yes vercel@62.2.0 link --yes --project mrstreamer-marketing --cwd apps/marketing
```

Then open the project's Settings and confirm all three:

| Setting                                 | Must be |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Build and Deployment > Root Directory   | Empty   |

The workflow runs the CLI with `--cwd apps/marketing`, and the CLI adds the project's Root Directory to that. A Root Directory of `apps/marketing` would send it looking for `apps/marketing/apps/marketing`. A Git connection would make Vercel build and publish on its own, beside the workflow.

`link` writes `apps/marketing/.vercel/project.json`, which is not committed. It holds the two ids the next step needs: `projectId` and `orgId`.

### 3. Make a token

On [vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens), create a token named for its use, such as `mrstreamer-marketing-github`. Scope it to the `mrstreamer-marketing` project alone and give it an expiry you will keep. Vercel shows the token once.

### 4. Give GitHub the token and the ids

In the repository's Settings > Environments, create `marketing-production`. Under Deployment branches and tags choose Selected branches and tags, and add `main`. Then add:

| Kind                 | Name                | Value                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Environment secret   | `VERCEL_TOKEN`      | The token                               |
| Environment variable | `VERCEL_ORG_ID`     | `orgId` from `.vercel/project.json`     |
| Environment variable | `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `projectId` from `.vercel/project.json` |

Or from a terminal, where `gh` asks for the token without showing it:

```sh
gh secret set VERCEL_TOKEN --env marketing-production --repo Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer
gh variable set VERCEL_ORG_ID --env marketing-production --repo Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer --body "<orgId>"
gh variable set VERCEL_PROJECT_ID --env marketing-production --repo Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer --body "<projectId>"
```

The token goes nowhere else: not in a file, a commit, an issue or a log. Leave required reviewers off this environment, or every publication waits for a click.

### 5. Publish the first time by hand

From an up-to-date `main`, build the same package the workflow builds and publish it with your own login:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build:marketing
npx --yes vercel@62.2.0 deploy --prebuilt --archive=tgz --prod --cwd apps/marketing
```

A project's first deployment is its production deployment. No domain is attached yet, so it is live only at the project's `vercel.app` address. Check there:

- The homepage, `/download`, `/releases`, `/about`, `/security`, `/docs` and a guide on a wide screen and a phone, also without JavaScript.
- `/privacy` and `/privacy/` both show the whole policy.
- An address with no page, such as `/nothing/here`, shows Page not found.
- `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/generated/social.png` answer.
- `/_vercel/insights/script.js` shows JavaScript, not Page not found.

### 6. Move the domain

If moving a domain that still redirects to GitHub, remove those redirects when it points to Vercel. The steps below preserve Cloudflare's email routing.

1. In Cloudflare, export the DNS records so you can put them back.
2. In Vercel, open the project's Settings > Domains and add `mrstreamer.app`. Accept the offer to add `www.mrstreamer.app` too.
3. Select Edit on `www.mrstreamer.app` and set Redirect to `mrstreamer.app`. The redirect keeps the path.
4. In Cloudflare DNS, replace the records for `mrstreamer.app` and `www` with the A and CNAME records Vercel shows for this project. Set both to DNS only, the grey cloud, so Vercel can issue the certificates.
5. Leave the MX records and the TXT records for mail as they are. `hello@`, `privacy@` and `security@` keep arriving through Cloudflare.
6. Turn off Cloudflare's rules that redirect `mrstreamer.app` and `mrstreamer.app/privacy`. They sit under Rules, as a redirect rule, a page rule or a bulk redirect.

Then check:

```sh
curl -sI https://mrstreamer.app/ | head -1                             # 200
curl -sI "https://www.mrstreamer.app/x?y=1" | grep -i location         # https://mrstreamer.app/x?y=1
curl -sI https://mrstreamer.app/privacy | head -1                      # 200
curl -sI https://mrstreamer.app/privacy/ | head -1                     # 200
curl -sI "https://mrstreamer.app/nothing/here?y=1" | head -1           # 404
curl -sI https://mrstreamer.app/_vercel/insights/script.js | head -1   # 200
```

Send a message to `hello@mrstreamer.app` and see it arrive. Open Settings > About in the app and follow its Website and Privacy links.

### 7. Turn on automatic publishing

```sh
gh variable set MARKETING_DEPLOY_ENABLED --repo Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer --body true
gh workflow run marketing-deploy.yml --repo Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer --ref main
```

Watch that run publish. From then on, a merge to `main` that changes any of these publishes the page:

- `apps/marketing/`
- `docs/assets/`
- `docs/privacy.md`, `docs/about.md`, `docs/security.md` and `docs/user/**`
- `packages/contracts/src/update-feed.ts` and `packages/contracts/src/version.ts`
- `apps/desktop/assets/brand/mark.svg`
- `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- either marketing workflow

Recorded stable promotions on `main` also start a publication through the guarded `workflow_run` trigger. The build always reads current `main` and never writes source files back to the repository.

## Turn it off, or go back

To stop publishing, set the variable to anything but `true`. The page stays as it is.

```sh
gh variable set MARKETING_DEPLOY_ENABLED --repo Mr-Streamer-OSS/MrStreamer --body false
```

To go back one publication, open the project in Vercel and choose Instant Rollback on the production deployment. The Hobby plan goes back to the deployment before the current one. After a rollback Vercel holds the domain on that deployment. The workflow still runs and its summary names each new deployment, but none of them goes live until you choose Undo Rollback.

To go back further, revert the commit on `main`. The workflow publishes the reverted page.

To take the site away, remove the two domains from the Vercel project and restore the DNS records you exported.

When the token expires, make a new one and set `VERCEL_TOKEN` again. A run without a token, or without either id, fails and names what is missing.

## Later, if you want Vercel to build from Git

Not set up, and not tried. It replaces the workflow, so do both of these first:

1. Set `MARKETING_DEPLOY_ENABLED` to `false`.
2. Confirm on a preview deployment that `/privacy` shows the policy and an address with no page answers 404.

Only then connect the repository in the project's Settings > Git, and give the project these settings:

| Setting                                  | Value                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root Directory                           | `apps/marketing`                                                                    |
| Include files outside the Root Directory | On, for the captures in `docs/assets`                                               |
| Framework Preset                         | Other                                                                               |
| Node.js Version                          | 24.x                                                                                |
| Install Command                          | `npx --yes pnpm@11.24.0 install --filter mrstreamer-marketing... --frozen-lockfile` |
| Build Command                            | `npx --yes pnpm@11.24.0 --filter mrstreamer-marketing build`                        |
| Output Directory                         | `dist`                                                                              |

Never run both. Two publishers on one project overwrite each other.
