// A fake Xtream Codes provider for tests. Its catalogue has the messiness of real panels:
// prefixed names, separator entries, numbers sent as strings and missing logos. It allows one
// connection at a time by default, like most subscriptions. The category "TEST | Formats and
// failures" streams the recordings in test/fixtures, one codec combination each, plus an offline
// channel; every other channel streams an empty MPEG-TS program. About half the channels have a
// guide id, shared by variants of one channel, and xmltv.php serves their programmes. The last
// category, "BE | Kwaliteit", lists one channel in Full HD, HD and SD, the Full HD one off air.
//
// Movies and series come with their own categories, one of them for adults, and one series is
// marked for adults in an ordinary category. Their files redirect
// to another address, as real panels do, and answer byte ranges; each open file holds a
// connection slot like a live stream. The "TEST" movies and the "TEST | Formats" series stream the
// title clips in test/fixtures; every other title streams the MP4 clip. One TEST movie and the
// "TEST | Formats" series come in two versions sharing a TMDB id, as providers list a title once
// per language.
