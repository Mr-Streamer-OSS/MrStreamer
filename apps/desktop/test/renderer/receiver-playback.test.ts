// @vitest-environment happy-dom
// A window that opens while a receiver plays, as after a reload, takes up what plays there once
// the lists name it: a channel in Watch, a movie or episode in its view, as the receiver has it
// by then. What the receiver let go of, lost or got something else in place of while the lists
// were asked is left alone: nothing shows, no watch is recorded, and a load that is gone is told
// nothing. So is what played when the login form took the pages' place, what played under the
// account before, and what the viewer played something else over.
