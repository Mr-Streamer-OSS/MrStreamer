// @vitest-environment happy-dom
// At the end of an episode the next one in its series plays after a ten-second countdown, which
// the viewer can cancel, skip with Play now or N, or turn off in Settings. It waits while Settings
// is open. One next episode opens, only once the countdown ends and the episode before has closed;
// leaving, another title or a new account plays nothing. A next episode that fails says it didn't start, and the last
// episode records that its series is finished once every other one is watched. The next one is
// the next the viewer hasn't watched: one played or marked watched is passed over, as the record
// stands when it counts, and nothing opens on an answer of the record's that is old or missing,
// or once the viewer took the next episode back while the record was asked.
