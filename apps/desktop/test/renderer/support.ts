// Stands in for the main process in the renderer's tests, which run with happy-dom. Every call is
// recorded; a call the test holds answers when the test says, and a method the test gave a
// standing answer, or failure, answers with it each time. The preferences otherwise answer with the defaults
// and what the test says the viewer saved, a subscription's with nothing left in it, how a
// series' episodes stand with nothing played and nothing marked, and anything else never answers.
// Like the main process, it refuses a call whose input the contract doesn't allow, so a view
// can't pass here with a call that fails there. Tests send its events themselves. Import it
// first, before the renderer's modules: it also stands in for Media Source Extensions and full
// screen, which happy-dom lacks, and for a text track's hidden mode, which it refuses.
