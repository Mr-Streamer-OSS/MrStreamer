// Putting the favourites in another order, in Live TV's Favourites list: a draft of the channels
// shown there, which the viewer arranges with each row's buttons or the keys. Save sends it once;
// Cancel, and leaving the list, throw it away. Until it is saved, nothing but this draft knows it.
//   The favourites are every saved subscription's, in one order, and the draft belongs to the
// subscriptions and the favourites it was read from. It closes when a subscription is added or
// removed, and when the favourites or the channels the list shows change under it, as a new
// catalogue or the setting for adults does. The main process checks the same as it saves, so an
// order from an older list never lands: it answers that the favourites changed, and the draft
// asks to be read again. Once saved, the list shows the channels the main process names for the
// record it answered with, and nothing of the draft.
//   Up and Down move the selection; PageUp, PageDown, Home and End jump. With Alt, or Option on a
// Mac, the same keys move the selected channel: one place, ten, or to the top or bottom. Enter
// saves and Escape cancels.
