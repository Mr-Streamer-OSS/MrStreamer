// Marking an episode watched or unwatched by hand, from the three dots on its row in a series'
// details. The mark is the viewer's word on the episode, in the subscription whose version the
// sheet shows: it opens no stream and leaves what plays alone. A row changes only once the main
// process stored the mark, and one mark is made at a time.
//
// The line under the season tabs says what was marked and offers Undo, which puts the episode and
// the series back exactly as they were. It goes once the series is marked again or played, when
// the main process would refuse the Undo. A mark that wasn't stored says so there too, with
// Retry, which sends the same change again: if the first was stored after all, nothing is stored
// twice.
