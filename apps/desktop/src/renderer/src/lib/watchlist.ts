// The watchlist as the views use it: whether a title is saved, saving it and taking it out. A
// change shows once the main process has stored it, never before, and a control makes one change
// at a time.
//   React hears that a change began a moment after it did. A press in that moment still reads
//   `isPending` as false, and would start a second change, whose answer the control then shows
//   instead of the first's. So each control keeps a ref beside it, set as its change starts and
//   cleared as it ends, stored or not. `isPending` then holds on until the control shows how the
//   change went, which is a moment after it ended.
