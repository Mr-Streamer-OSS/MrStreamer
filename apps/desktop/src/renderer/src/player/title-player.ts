// The controller for movies and episodes: which title is open, where it is, its tracks, and
// what the viewer does with it. It plays in the same element as live TV (see player.ts): opening a
// title stops the live stream, and starting a live channel closes the title, so the provider sees
// one connection.
//
// How far the title got is saved as the viewer goes: every minute while playing, and at each
// pause, seek, track change, the end, leaving and hiding the window. Never per frame.
//
// A title can play faster or slower, keeping the pitch (the element's `preservesPitch`, on by
// default). The speed lasts for the title, and carries on when another episode of its series opens
// from it, as Next episode does; live channels always play at their own.
//
// An episode knows the next one in its series: the next the viewer hasn't watched, in the version
// that plays, since one played or marked watched already is passed over. At its end that one
// plays after a countdown, unless the viewer turned it off or cancels; Next plays it at once.
// Which one it is comes from the viewing record alone: it is asked as the episode opens, as the
// record changes, as the episode ends and once more before the next one opens, so a mark made
// meanwhile counts, and while the record doesn't answer none is offered and none opens. A mark
// alone never stops, moves or starts anything that plays. Watching an episode into its credits
// records that the series is finished once no numbered episode is left to watch: one before it
// that isn't watched keeps the series in Continue watching.
//
// With a receiver on the network connected (see output.ts), a title plays there instead: it is
// opened and loaded through the main process, the controls here command the receiver, and the
// position, the length and whether it plays are what the receiver last confirmed. The main process
// saves how far it got. Connecting a receiver while a title plays here moves it there at its
// position, with its tracks; going back to this computer brings it back the same way. A receiver
// that takes another's place, or is reached again after its connection broke, has nothing of the
// title: it is opened and loaded there afresh, where it was, paused when it was. Wherever it
// plays, it is the one play the viewer began, and its progress is saved as that play's.
