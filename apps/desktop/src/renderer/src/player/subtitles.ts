// cues, and those due show as lines at the foot of the layer. Pictures, PGS and DVB, go on a canvas
// in it: cues on a metadata track show and hide them. Both tracks are hidden, so Chromium times
// the cues on the element's own clock and draws none, and nothing repaints between changes.

// The viewer's timing and look live here rather than on the cues, so they hold for whichever track
// shows, after every seek and every new run. Text cues keep the times their file gave them and
// show `delay` seconds later; pictures keep theirs. The look is CSS on the layer (styles.css), and
// a scale when pictures are drawn; how high subtitles sit is CSS for both.
