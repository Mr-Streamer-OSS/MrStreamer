// Movies and episodes through Media Source Extensions. One run plays the title from a position
// with the chosen tracks, as the proxy sends it (see src/main/playback/title.ts): fragmented MP4
// whose `x-start` header says where its picture begins. Placing the fragments there makes the
// element's clock the title's clock, so the position is `currentTime`, a seek into what is
// already buffered is instant, and subtitle cues line up without arithmetic in the view.
//
// With subtitles on, a run reads their feed beside the picture, which never waits for it (see
// @mrstreamer/core/subtitles/feed): what the track holds before the run's start, then the
// subtitles as the run reads them. Independent text shows as it arrives while recovery continues.
// Packet changes wait for the recovered state; then what is on screen where the picture has got to
// shows at once, such as a picture, page or caption that began long before the start. When the
// first part can't be had the run says so, and the picture plays on. The run also says whether a
// cue it has is due at the position, so text that shows is never called loading or unavailable.
//
// Reading holds back once enough is buffered ahead. While paused nothing more is read, and the
// provider's connection sits idle until playback moves on; the controller ends the run after a
// long pause.
