// The player controller: owns the one video element, the open stream session and the playback state.
//
// Every `play` call starts a new selection. Anything that resolves for an older selection is
// dropped, so a slow channel can never replace the one the viewer picked after it.
//
// The main process picks which of a channel's streams plays: the quality chosen for it, else
// Automatic, which may pass a stream that doesn't start. Once one plays, the controller asks which.
//
// A channel's sound and subtitle tracks come from its program table once the stream starts.
// Another sound track opens the stream again with it; subtitles are decoded here from the
// stream's private data, timed on the element's clock, and shown over the picture.
//
// An HLS stream's tracks come from its engine instead, which reads them from the stream's
// playlists and says so again whenever they change: its sound switches where it plays, and the
// lines of its subtitles and captions go on the element's subtitle track as they are read. The
// same choices and the same remembered languages apply to both.
//
// The video element outlives every view: Home's backdrop, the guide's preview and Watch each show
// it in turn (see Picture.tsx), so moving between them never reopens the stream. Only Watch plays
// sound unless the viewer unmutes elsewhere; `audible` is that choice, `muted` the viewer's own.
//
// With a receiver on the network connected (see output.ts), a channel the viewer chooses plays
// there: the main process opens it for the receiver, and the state here is what the receiver
// confirmed. Nothing previews meanwhile, as a preview would take the provider's connection from
// the receiver. A channel has no pause and no subtitles there; one the receiver itself holds
// paused or buffering, as after Pause on the TV's remote, says so here. What the receiver says is
// shown as it says it, and only its word that the channel plays makes it one that started: a
// receiver can hold a channel paused or buffering before it ever got its stream.
//
// A stream that breaks is tried again a few times, here and on a receiver alike, and those tries
// are the channel's until it has played for a while: one that comes back for a moment and breaks
// off again uses them up and fails, rather than reconnecting for ever. Choosing the channel
// again, or Retry, starts afresh. What a failure says is the kind of thing that went wrong and
// the provider's status, never the words an engine or the provider used for it.
