// System media controls: what macOS's Now Playing, Windows' media overlay and Linux's MPRIS show
// for what plays, and what their buttons and the keyboard's media keys do. Chromium hands
// `navigator.mediaSession` on to each.
//
// A movie or episode shows its name, its series and "S1 E3", and its TMDB artwork, and takes play,
// pause, 10 s back and forward, seeking and, when there is one, the next episode. A channel shows
// the programme, the channel and its logo, and takes only play and stop: a headphone's double tap
// must never change channel. Pausing a channel stops it, and Chromium then has nothing playing to
// offer the system, so Watch in the app starts it again. Artwork must be http or https, or a data
// URL; Chromium refuses the app's own file:// pictures. Only Watch and a playing title present
// anything, so the muted previews leave the system alone.
//
// What a receiver on the network plays answers the same buttons, from what it last confirmed, in
// its player's view and from the bar at the foot of the pages. Chromium offers the system only a
// window that plays sound itself, and a receiver's playback makes none here, so a silent loop
// plays in step with the receiver meanwhile (`carry`). With the window closed, as macOS allows
// while a receiver plays, there is no session and the media keys reach nothing.
