 * overrides where it goes, as a playing title or an open collection does. Subscriptions with
 * live TV only have no Movies, Series or Watchlist. Where the window is too narrow for every

 * place also says how the downloads stand while one is under way, waits or stopped, except over
 * the Downloads page itself while its name is in the bar. Where even the other names, or Back,
 * don't fit beside those words, it keeps its arrow alone and says them on hover and focus.
