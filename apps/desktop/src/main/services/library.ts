// The live catalogue: each saved subscription's, fetched from its provider and cached on disk,
// and all of them together as the UI asks for them over IPC. Every channel and category says
// which subscription lists it, and a request names its channels and categories the same way. A
// cache keeps the provider's ids as they came, under the account's key, in its subscription's
// folder.
//
// The catalogues stay apart underneath. Lists show them together: every channel as each
// subscription's block in the order the subscriptions were added, a search across all of them
// before it is cut, and categories of several subscriptions as one where they show under the same
// country and name. One subscription that can't be reached keeps the channels it loaded before
// and says so in its own status; the others are not held up by it.
