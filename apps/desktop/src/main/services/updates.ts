// In-app updates and the release channel.
//
// The app checks on its own after starting and every four hours, quietly: an automatic check that
// fails keeps what the last one found and tries again later, backing off, and waits for GitHub
// when GitHub asks. The user can check at any time. Nothing downloads or installs on its own: the
// user downloads, then confirms the restart, and a download never restarts the app.
//
// The first run stores the build's own channel; after that only the user changes it, so a Nightly
// user who installs a stable build stays on Nightly. Switching a nightly build to Stable offers
// the newest stable release even when it is older, and installs it over the nightly like any
// update: this device's data stays.
