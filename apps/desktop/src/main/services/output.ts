// Where playback goes: this computer, or a receiver on the local network, a TV the viewer sends
// it to with Google Cast or AirPlay.
//
// The playback service stays the one owner of every stream. This service decides who plays it:
// it holds the receiver the viewer chose, opens sessions for it there, has the receiver's adapter
// load them (see ../receivers/adapter.ts), and keeps what the receiver last confirmed. The UI's
// controls act on that and show it; the receiver's own clock is the title's clock while it plays.
//
// Looking for receivers and connecting to one change nothing that plays. Only playing something
// on a connected receiver closes what was open here, through the playback service, so the
// provider sees one connection throughout. Going back closes the receiver's session first.
//
// One receiver at a time. Connecting to one the app lists lets go of the one before, with what it
// played. The system's own list decides nothing until the viewer picks in it: a receiver that
// plays goes on while the list is open, and stays when it closes with nothing else picked. A list
// counts from when it is asked for, also while it still waits for the place it opens at: going
// back to this computer, another receiver, another account or another list ends it there, and
// none opens.
//
// Every load has a generation, counted here, and the account it began under. A command names its
// generation and is dropped once another load took its place. What a receiver says of an earlier
// load is dropped too, so a late answer can't move the clock of what plays now, save progress
// under another account, or end an episode that is no longer the one playing.
//
// How far a title got on a receiver is saved here, from what the receiver confirmed: each minute
// while it plays, and when it pauses, is skipped in, ends, stops or is lost. The UI saves that for
// what plays on this computer; a receiver plays on with the window closed, when there is no UI.
//
// A receiver plays from an address of this computer, so the app has to stay open: quitting ends
// what the receiver plays.
