// The watchlist: movies and whole series the viewer saved to watch later. It is apart from the
// viewing record: playing, finishing or leaving Continue watching changes no entry, and saving or
// removing one changes nothing of how far a title got.
//
// What an account saved is its own, kept by the provider's own ids as the viewing record is. The
// watchlist the viewer sees is every saved subscription's together. A film two of them list
// under one TMDB id is one title in the lists and one entry here, whichever of them saved it;
// nothing else joins what two subscriptions saved, so a record without that proof stays an entry
// of its own (see @mrstreamer/core/ondemand/watchlist).
//
// Saving a title saves it for every subscription that lists a version of it now, in one
// transaction: all of them or none. Nobody is asked which. A subscription added later that lists
// the title too plays it from the same entry, and is given no record of it by itself. Removing an
// entry takes out what every subscription saved of it, also where its provider lists it no more.
//
// What is saved is worked out here, from the title as the lists have it: its name, year and
// kind, whether it is for adults, its TMDB id and the ids of each subscription's versions. The UI
// names a title by one of its versions and sends nothing else, and no provider is asked anything.
// A change is told to the UI after it is stored.
//
// Which title an entry is now, the lists say each time the watchlist is read, so an entry no
// provider lists any more stays, without a title, and has one again when it is listed again.
