// for TMDB: what it says joins them once it arrives, and `detailsChanged` says so.
// A title, version or episode a call names says which subscription lists it, and one of a
// subscription that isn't saved finds nothing. The lists are those of every saved subscription
// that has movies and series, shown as one catalogue: an unmapped playlist adds none.
// Each subscription's lists are fetched, kept and reported on their own, so one that can't be
// reached keeps what it loaded and holds no other back.
