// The saved subscriptions: each validated with its provider and stored with a sealed password or,
// for a playlist, a sealed link. Every one of them shows in the app at once; none is "the active
// one".
//
// subscription.json is the login as every release has kept it, and the newest stable release
// still reads and writes it: it stays the only place for that login, its sealed secret and the
// account's status. The subscription it holds is the original. A subscription added beside it
// keeps the same file in a folder of its own, subscriptions/<id>, with the lists loaded from it
// and what the viewer left it at, where no older release looks.
//
// subscriptions.json, the registry, lists the saved subscriptions in the order they were added
// and gives each the id the rest of the app names it by. An entry holds that id, the account it
// was given to, as its server and username or a playlist's fingerprint, and the name the viewer
// gave it; never the password or a playlist's link. The entry marked `original` is the one whose
// login subscription.json holds. An entry this build can't read stays as it found it, in its
// place.
//
// The files are written one after the other, the login first, and a stable release changes
// subscription.json without the registry. So each start settles them, with the logins deciding
// (see `settle`): the original's account keeps its id while it stays the same account, an added
// subscription is there while its folder holds its login, and nothing else is touched. An account
// shows once: a folder that holds one saved already stays as it is, and isn't shown. What an
// account loaded and what the viewer kept stay under the account's own key.
