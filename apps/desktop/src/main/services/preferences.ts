// Viewing settings in preferences.json. Two kinds share the file, as they always have, so the
// newest stable release reads and writes it too. Preferences hold whichever subscription plays:
// volume, mute, languages, the quality live channels start in. What the viewer left a subscription
// at is that subscription's alone, because every id in it is its provider's own: the last channel
// and category, and the versions and streams picked. The file keeps those of the original
// subscription, the one older releases know; a subscription added beside it keeps its own in a
// preferences.json in its folder, which holds nothing else. Those are read and changed by naming
// the subscription, and one that isn't saved has none. Reads and changes take turns at the files,
// and one that names a subscription checks that it is saved when its turn comes: the subscription
// may have gone while it waited. The interface language is kept beside them, and changed only
// through `setInterfaceLanguage`.
