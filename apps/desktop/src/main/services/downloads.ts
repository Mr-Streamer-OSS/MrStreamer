// Movies and episodes downloaded to this computer: the queue, its one transfer at a time, and the
// copies that play without a subscription. Each download is a record in the database
// (../platform/downloads-store.ts) and a folder of its own in the app's downloads folder, with
// the file, a partial file while it transfers, and the artwork kept for it. Paths, addresses and
// logins stay here; the window sees the records as `Download`s.
//
// One download transfers at a time, of whichever subscription: the first in the queue whose
// subscription plays nothing. Playback lends it that subscription's provider connection and takes
// it back for any stream of that subscription (see Playback.lend): the transfer stops, its
// request ends, and it waits in the queue with its partial file until nothing of its subscription
// plays. Another subscription's stream lets it go on. A transfer goes on from its partial file
// only when the provider proves it is the same file; otherwise it starts again and says so (see
// ../downloads/transfer.ts). It becomes a copy once every byte is on disk: the partial is flushed,
// renamed, and only then marked complete. Quitting keeps the queue and its partial files.
//
// Only what the database says decides which folders are no download's: when it can't be read,
// nothing is listed, queued or cleaned up, and each call says so. A row this build can't read
// keeps its folder for the build that wrote it.
//
// A copy keeps what it needs to show and play without asking anyone: its details and artwork,
// read as it was queued, how far it was watched here, and the subtitles saved for the exact file
// it was made from (see `subtitlesOfCopy`). Removing a subscription cancels its unfinished
// downloads; its copies stay, and play, until the viewer deletes them.
