// Stream sessions and the loopback proxy that serves them to the UI.
//
// The UI never sees provider URLs: they carry the login. It gets a 127.0.0.1 URL with a random
// token instead. Only one session is open at a time, live or on demand, so switching always
// releases the previous provider connection first. Many subscriptions allow a single connection.
//
// Live: the proxy reads the start of each MPEG-TS stream to learn its codecs. A stream the UI's
// player decodes passes through untouched; otherwise ffmpeg converts only the tracks it cannot
// decode. A channel with several streams, one per quality, can be given more than one to try, as
// Auto is: when the provider doesn't deliver one, the proxy asks for the next, after the request
// before is over, and never after a refusal, which is the account's. Streams that failed in the
// last two minutes go last, so reconnecting doesn't wait for one again. An HLS stream, as
// playlists list them, passes through playlist by playlist and segment by segment, its addresses
// replaced by the proxy's (see ../playback/hls.ts).
//
// Movies and episodes (see ../playback/title.ts): the proxy serves the provider's file to ffprobe
// and ffmpeg over loopback, answering byte ranges, one upstream request at a time. Each request
// from the player runs ffmpeg from a position with the chosen tracks, and replaces the run before.
// With subtitles on, the player also asks for their feed, and the picture doesn't wait for it:
// what the track holds before the position, as far back as the subtitles on screen there depend
// on, then what the run reads. The proxy keeps what each run reads of a track
// (see ../playback/subtitle-history.ts) and reads the rest from the file itself, only the track's
// packets (see ../playback/matroska.ts), when playback spares the provider and no more than a
// bounded amount (see ../playback/upstream.ts). What can't be had that way leaves the subtitles
// unavailable for the position, never the picture. All it keeps is of one file: when an answer
// shows the provider put another behind the address, it starts afresh
// (see ../playback/source-identity.ts).
//
// A receiver on the local network, a TV the viewer sends playback to, has no player of ours. A
// session opened for one is the same single session, served a second way: as HLS on an address of
// this computer on that network, which exists only while the session does and answers only that
// session's playlists and segments, under a token of its own. A channel's MPEG-TS goes through
// ffmpeg into segments; a channel's HLS has its playlists pointed at that address; a movie gets a
// complete playlist and its segments made as the receiver asks for them (see
// ../playback/receiver.ts). Everything ffmpeg and ffprobe read and report stays on loopback.
//
// Each session is a scope within the service's. Closing it, by stopping, switching or quitting,
// aborts its upstream requests, which ends their ffmpeg processes; the proxy closes with the
// service.
