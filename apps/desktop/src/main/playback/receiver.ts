// memory a few at a time. A receiver has no player of ours, so it gets a playlist it can read by
// itself and asks for the segments; the proxy makes them as they are asked for.
//
// A movie or episode gets a complete playlist, with the length the file says, so the receiver
// shows the title's own clock and can skip anywhere. Its segments have to start where the playlist
// says, to the frame. A picture the receiver decodes is copied, which only allows a segment to
// start on a keyframe the file's index names: ffmpeg starts a run there, and cuts where the next
// ones are. A file without such an index, or with a picture the receiver doesn't decode, has its
// picture converted, with a keyframe made at each start instead. Every time here is a picture's
// presentation time on the file's clock, as ffprobe and the file's index give them.
//
// A channel has no length: ffmpeg cuts what the provider sends every two seconds or so, and says
// how long each piece turned out.
