// The movie and series catalogue, in a worker thread. Its lists run to tens of megabytes, and
// reading, indexing and sorting them would hold the main process for hundreds of milliseconds;
// here that costs nothing the viewer notices. The main process sends small calls and gets pages.
//
// Each subscription's lists are kept as its provider sent them, in memory and in its folder
// (ondemand.json.gz), and display names are worked out on load. What the lists show is made of
// all of them at once: one catalogue, in which a film two subscriptions list under one TMDB id is
// one title. It is sorted, searched and counted whole and cut into pages only then, so no
// subscription is cut short before another's titles are in, and a page never holds a film twice.
// One worker holds every subscription's lists; none gets a thread of its own.
//
// A refresh takes two calls. The lists it fetches wait aside until the main process, which knows
// the saved login, says whether they still count: only then do they show and reach the disk.
