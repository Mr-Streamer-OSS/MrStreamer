// The viewing record on disk, in the SQLite database it shares with the watchlist (database.ts):
// the events in order, the state they add up to per account, one row per movie or episode played,
// one per episode marked by hand and one per marked series, with the episodes it listed and what
// its latest mark replaced, the ids of commands already done and a few markers. Every command is
// one transaction. When the rules change (STATE_VERSION), the state is rebuilt from the events at
// start. If the database can't open, the record reports failures and the rest of the app carries
// on.
//
// What an event does to the title rows and the marks is one function, `project`, run on the
// tables as a change commits and on a rebuild's memory, so a record rebuilt from its events
// reads as the one they were committed to.
//
// Everything in it is kept per account, by the provider's own ids: the service says which
// subscription an account's channels and titles belong to, and nothing here names one.
//
// Several accounts read as one give their favourites in the order starred and their channels by
// when they were watched, whichever account each is of. Nothing stored says so beyond the events:
// their sequence runs through every account, so the event that gave an entry its place tells
// where it stands among the others'. That is worked out from an account's channel events once
// per run, and kept current as changes commit; a single account's lists never need it.
//
// Older builds read this file too, as when someone goes back to an earlier nightly: they skip
// event types they don't know, leave the titles table alone, and insert events without a payload.
// Builds with movies and series before `removed_at`, Stable 0.0.3 among them, write title rows
// without it, and read `hidden` as this one writes it. Builds from before marks write title rows
// without `since`, which then read as a play begun when the row was saved, and never look at the
// tables that hold the marks: a mark is no title row, so none of them takes it for a play. When
// such a build erases an account it leaves that account's marks, which this one deletes at its
// next start: none are kept without the events that made them.
