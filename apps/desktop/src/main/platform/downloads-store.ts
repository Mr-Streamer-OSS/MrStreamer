// The downloads on disk, in the SQLite database the viewing record and the watchlist share
// (database.ts): one row per download in a table of its own, which builds before downloads never
// read or erase. A row is the download's whole record as one document: the exact provider file it
// was made from, what was kept of its details, how far its transfer got and how far the copy was
// watched here. Its bytes and artwork are files in the app's downloads folder (services/downloads.ts).
// Erasing an account's viewing data leaves these rows: a copy is the viewer's until they delete it.
// A row this build can't read, as one a later build wrote, is left as it is, and so are its files.
