// The watchlist on disk, in the SQLite database it shares with the viewing record (database.ts):
// one row per saved movie or series and account, and one per version of it, which names the
// provider's row it was saved from. They are tables of their own. Nothing here is an event, and
// nothing the viewing record rebuilds from its events touches them, so playing, finishing or
// leaving Continue watching changes no entry.
//
// Like the viewing record, everything is kept per account by the provider's own ids, and nothing
// here names a subscription: the service says whose an account's rows are. A film several
// subscriptions list is saved once in each account that listed it then, and those rows are one
// entry by the TMDB id they share. A change to an entry writes every account's row of it in one
// transaction, so it is stored for all of them or for none.
//
// Which rows are a title, `sameTitle` says, and which are one entry, `sameEntry` (see
// @mrstreamer/core/ondemand/watchlist). The indexes only find the rows to ask them about.
//
// An entry is named by the row it was saved with first. A row an account gets of an entry later
// takes the entry's time, so the entry keeps its place when the first account goes. What tells
// the two rows apart then is the order they were written in, which is the order of their rowids:
// SQLite gives a new row a higher one than any row the table holds, and a row keeps its own
// while it is updated in place. So a row is updated, never replaced, and whatever rebuilds the
// table has to copy the rows in that order.
//
// A row holds a name, a year, a kind and whether it is for adults, to show when the provider
// lists it no more, and nothing else of the title: no address, no artwork, no details.
//
// Builds from before the watchlist share the file and never look at these tables: what they
// rebuild and what they erase is the viewing record's alone.
