# Live TV

## Home

Home plays the channel you watched last, muted, behind what's on it now: the programme, how long it has left and what comes next. **Watch** opens it full window with sound, on the same stream, so it doesn't start again. The speaker button turns the sound on without leaving Home.

Below come one row each of what you were watching (see [Movies and series](movies-and-series.md)), your favourite channels, the channels you watched recently, new movies, new series and your current category. **All** opens the whole list in Live TV, Movies or Series, and **All channels** opens every channel.

Until you've watched something, the backdrop shows a channel without playing it.

Your subscription may allow a single connection. Home then uses it as soon as it opens, so if another device is already watching, the backdrop stays still instead of taking the connection over. With [several subscriptions](subscriptions.md), Home plays the channel you watched last, whichever it is from. Minimising Mr. Streamer, hiding it behind other windows, or going to Movies or Series stops the muted backdrop; it starts again when you come back.

## The guide

**Live TV** lists your favourites, recently watched channels, all channels and every category on the left, from [every subscription you added](subscriptions.md#everything-together). A channel that reads like one of another subscription says which one it is from. When a subscription's channels couldn't be fetched, a line above the list says so, with **Retry**, and the others show as usual. The channels on the right show what's on now, with how long it has left, and what's next. The channel you're watching plays muted at the top.

- Click a channel to watch it. **Back**, or Escape, returns to the same place in the list.
- The arrow at the end of a row lists the rest of the day. Click a later programme to read about it.
- The star adds a channel to your favourites. A new favourite goes last, and **Reorder** puts them in the order you want.

The field beside the list's name searches the list you're looking at: Favourites, Recently watched, All channels or one category. It finds a channel by its name, also the full name your provider gives it, and by the programmes on now and later today, whatever the capitals and accents. The channels it finds stay in the list's order, with what matched underlined. A later programme that matched stands at the end of its row with its time, and the arrow opens the rest of the day on it. Clicking the row still watches the channel as it is now.

/ puts the cursor in the field. Down or Enter there moves to the channels found, and Escape clears the search, as picking another list does. When nothing in the list matches, **Search all channels** looks for the same in every channel. Searching uses what Mr. Streamer already has, so typing asks your provider nothing.

**Reorder**, beside the field in Favourites, or R, puts your favourites in another order. Every row gets an Up and a Down button: a click moves the channel one place, and a click with Shift moves it to the top or the bottom. On the keyboard, Up and Down choose a row, and with Alt held, Option on a Mac, they move it. Page Up and Page Down move it ten places, Home and End to the top and the bottom. **Save**, or Enter, keeps the order. **Cancel**, or Escape, drops it, and so does leaving the list. Nothing plays while you reorder.

A search hides favourites, so Reorder asks you to clear it first and clears nothing by itself. If the order can't be saved, Mr. Streamer says so and keeps what you arranged: **Retry** saves it again. If your favourites changed in the meantime, **Reload** starts over from them.

Home, the guide and the channel list while watching show your favourites in that order, and channel up and down follow it. The channel numbers stay your provider's, and so does the quality each channel plays in. A favourite that isn't showing, a channel for adults while those are hidden or one your provider stopped listing, keeps its place and comes back to it. One quality of a channel that your provider stops listing keeps its place too: if you moved the channel further down meanwhile, it goes back up to that place when the quality returns.

Favourites and watch history from all your subscriptions show as one list each. Each entry still belongs to its own subscription: removing a subscription takes its favourites and history out of the lists, and they come back when you add the same account again, unless you chose to delete them.

Providers often list a channel once per quality: "VRT 1 FHD", "VRT 1 HD", "VRT 1 SD". Mr. Streamer shows those as one channel, with its qualities after the name, when they are surely the same channel: same name, same region and language, and the same category or one named only for a quality, such as "BE | 4K". Anything less certain stays a row of its own. A channel you starred, or watched, under one of its qualities is the same favourite and the same history entry.

Channels your provider marks for adults, or files in a category named for adults, stay hidden until you turn on **For adults** in Settings > General. Then they show in Live TV's lists and the guide, where the field beside a list's name finds them, but never on Home or in ⌘K's search.

Programme information comes from your provider. Many providers only cover some channels, and some cover none; those channels show their name and category instead. Some providers file unrelated channels under one channel's guide; Mr. Streamer leaves those channels without programmes rather than show the wrong ones. The guide updates every six hours. To use a guide from another address, or to give a channel the guide channel you pick, see [A guide from another address](subscriptions.md#a-guide-from-another-address).

## Watching

While watching, the channel list opens over the left of the picture with the list button, Enter or the left arrow. Click a channel to switch; its title switches to another category. Clicking the picture shows the controls, and a double click toggles full screen. Scroll over the picture to switch channel, once per gesture.

The bar keeps Channels, Favourite, Stop or Watch, CC when available, volume, full screen and **More**. More holds channel up, channel down, the previous channel, Sound, Quality, Playback, Play on and Mini player.

- **Sound**, in More, shows when a channel has more than one sound track. Picking another starts the channel again with it, which takes a moment. An HLS channel, as most of a playlist's are, switches without starting again.
- **CC** lists the channel's subtitles: DVB subtitles, teletext subtitle pages and closed captions, and on an HLS channel the subtitles its stream offers. C turns the last ones you picked on and off.
- **Playback**, in More, moves teletext subtitles and captions earlier or later, until you switch channel, and sets how subtitles look, as for [movies and series](movies-and-series.md#watching). Live channels play at their own speed.
- **Quality**, in More, shows on a channel with several qualities. Its page says which one plays. Q opens it directly.
- **Mini player**, in More, or P, shrinks the window into a small picture on top of other windows, as for [movies and series](movies-and-series.md#watching). Up and Down still switch channel; opening the list puts the window back.
- The keyboard's media keys and the system's own controls show the programme, the channel and its logo. Pause or stop there stops the channel, and **Watch** starts it again. Next and previous do nothing, so a tap on your headphones never changes channel. On [a TV](playback.md#playing-on-a-tv), a channel paused with the TV's own remote shows as paused, and play there plays it on.

The languages you pick carry over to other channels, and to movies and series. A channel in another language starts with subtitles in yours when it has them. Subtitles a stream marks as its own default don't come on by themselves.

### Quality

Channels start in Full HD, or the nearest quality the channel has, lower first. Change that in Settings > General > Live TV. If your provider has no stream for a quality right now, or doesn't answer, Automatic tries the next, at most three, one after another, and the line under the programme says so: "Full HD didn't start, playing HD". If the provider refuses the stream, Automatic stops there instead of trying more streams against a refusal. The status doesn't say why, so Mr. Streamer can't tell whether another quality would play.

Pick a quality in the menu and that channel keeps it. When it doesn't start, Mr. Streamer says why and offers another instead of switching on its own. **Use Automatic** in the menu, or **Reset** in Settings for every channel, goes back to Automatic.

After a channel fell back or failed, the menu says what became of each quality on that try: "No stream · 404", "Refused · 403", "Error · 503", "No data", "No picture", "Can't play", "Playing" or "Not tried". The number is the provider's HTTP status.

The quality is the word your provider puts in the channel's name. The resolution beside it is what the picture actually is. A channel whose name gives no quality says "Not labelled".

### When a channel doesn't play

The middle of the picture says what went wrong, with a small line of what Mr. Streamer observed: the provider's HTTP status, the qualities it tried, how often it reconnected and the time. [What plays](playback.md#when-something-wont-play) lists each message.

- **Retry**, or R, opens the same channel again in the quality it had.
- **Quality** opens the quality menu. Nothing starts until you pick one.
- **Channels** opens the list. **Next channel** takes Quality's place when the channel has no quality left to try.
- A refusal offers Retry and Channels only, and Mr. Streamer never changes channel by itself.

When the picture stands still for three seconds, "Waiting for data" shows at the top right until it moves again. When data stays away for fifteen seconds, or the provider ends the stream, the channel reconnects: up to four times, after 1, 2, 4 and 8 seconds, and **Stop** ends that. A channel that comes back and breaks off again within 30 seconds gets no extra tries, so a stream that keeps dropping ends with "Keeps dropping" instead of reconnecting for ever. Once it played for 30 seconds, the next break has all four again. The mini player, and the bar at the foot of the pages while [a TV](playback.md#playing-on-a-tv) plays, say the same in a few words.

## Search

⌘K (Ctrl K on Windows and Linux) searches every channel, movies and series, and the programmes on now and later today, in every subscription. Pick a channel, or a programme that's on, to watch it. Pick a later programme to read about it, or a movie or series to see its details. Opened from Live TV, it starts with what the list's field searched for. Live TV searches the list it shows from [that field](#the-guide), and Movies and Series their own titles from a field in their tabs; see [Movies and series](movies-and-series.md#finding-something).
