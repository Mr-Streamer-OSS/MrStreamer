# Signing

Mac releases are signed with a Developer ID, hardened, notarized and stapled, so a downloaded DMG opens without warnings and updates keep access to the Keychain. Windows signing comes later; see [releasing](releasing.md#windows-signing).

## Credentials

| What                                        | Where                                                                                 | Expires                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apple Developer Program membership          | The Account Holder's Apple account                                                    | Yearly renewal                                                     |
| Team ID                                     | Repository variable `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                                                   | Never                                                              |
| Developer ID Application, for releases      | Repository secrets `MAC_CERTIFICATE_P12` (base64 .p12) and `MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Five years after it was issued (the current one in September 2031) |
| App Store Connect API key, for notarization | Repository secrets `APPLE_API_KEY_P8`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`         | Never; revoke it to end it                                         |

The release certificate belongs to GitHub Actions only: its private key was generated for it and exists nowhere else. Machines that build signed releases themselves get their own Developer ID, so each can be revoked alone. The notarization key has the Developer role, which can notarize but not manage users, certificates or apps.

Only the Account Holder can create Developer ID certificates. Apple refuses to issue them through the API, so a new one needs a certificate request uploaded at developer.apple.com.

## Setting up or renewing

`scripts/setup-release-signing.sh` walks through every step and stores the results in the repository settings. It needs `gh` signed in with admin access. For the Developer ID it runs `scripts/ci-signing-identity.ts`:

```sh
node scripts/ci-signing-identity.ts request   # key and request in .local/ci-signing, printed for upload
# upload the request at developer.apple.com: Developer ID Application, G2 Sub-CA
node scripts/ci-signing-identity.ts finish    # finds the certificate, stores the .p12 and its password
node scripts/ci-signing-identity.ts status    # the team's Developer ID certificates and expiry dates
```

`finish` and `status` look certificates up through the App Store Connect API when `ASC_KEY_PATH`, `ASC_KEY_ID` and `ASC_ISSUER_ID` name an Admin key; without one, pass the downloaded certificate with `finish --cer <file>`.

Renew the release certificate a few months before it expires. A new certificate from the same team keeps updates working: macOS checks the team and app id, not the certificate. Releases signed with the old one keep opening after it expires, because their signatures are timestamped.

## If something is compromised

- **The notarization key:** revoke it in App Store Connect under Users and Access > Integrations, then create a new one with the wizard.
- **The release certificate:** revoke it at developer.apple.com and create a new one. Revoking can stop apps signed with it from opening, so publish a release signed with the new certificate right away.
- A lapsed membership stops notarization; published releases keep working.

## Checking a build

The release workflow checks every Mac build. By hand:

```sh
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "Mr. Streamer.app"
codesign -dv "Mr. Streamer.app"          # Authority=Developer ID Application, TeamIdentifier, flags=0x10000(runtime)
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose "Mr. Streamer.app"   # source=Notarized Developer ID
xcrun stapler validate "Mr. Streamer.app"
spctl --assess --type open --context context:primary-signature --verbose Mr-Streamer-*.dmg
xcrun stapler validate Mr-Streamer-*.dmg
```

To sign on your own Mac, keep a Developer ID Application identity in your keychain and set `APPLE_API_KEY` (the path of a .p8), `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER` for notarization before `pnpm dist:mac`.
