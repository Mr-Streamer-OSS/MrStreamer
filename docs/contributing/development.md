# Development

Needs Node 24 and pnpm 11. `package.json` lists every script.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # the app with hot reload
pnpm knip         # unused files, exports and dependencies
pnpm lint         # oxlint
pnpm fmt:check    # Prettier
pnpm typecheck    # main, preload and shared code, then the renderer
pnpm test         # Vitest
pnpm build        # production bundles in apps/desktop/out/
```

The repository is a pnpm workspace: the app is `apps/desktop`, the website is `apps/marketing`, shared contracts and rules are in `packages/`; [architecture](architecture.md) shows the layout. `pnpm dev:marketing`, `pnpm build:marketing` and `pnpm preview:marketing` run the website, which [its README](../../apps/marketing/README.md) describes. The scripts above run from the root. If `pnpm dev` reports that Electron failed to install, as a fresh install from pnpm's store can leave it, run `node node_modules/electron/install.js`.

## Running the app

Live TV works without a subscription: on the Connect screen, choose **Use an M3U link** and paste iptv-org's public playlist, `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u`. [Testing](testing.md#a-real-provider) says what it covers and how to read a channel that fails. Movies and series need a provider that offers them, through an Xtream Codes login. If you use your own subscription, keep its details out of the repository: the gitignored `.local/` folder is the place for private notes and test access.

Genres, streaming services and popularity in Movies and Series come from TMDB. A development build has no key built in: set `MR_STREAMER_TMDB_KEY`, or paste one in Settings > General with **Own key…**. A free TMDB account gets one.

Streams the player can't decode go through ffmpeg, and every movie and episode goes through ffprobe and ffmpeg (see [architecture](architecture.md#playback)). Development builds use the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on your PATH (`brew install ffmpeg`, `apt install ffmpeg` or `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`); packaged builds use their bundled copies.

Playing on a TV uses Google Cast on Windows and AirPlay on macOS (see [architecture](architecture.md#receivers)). Cast needs nothing built. AirPlay needs the helper: `apps/desktop/scripts/build-airplay-helper.sh mac-arm64` on a Mac with Xcode's command line tools puts it in `apps/desktop/vendor/airplay`, where `pnpm dev` and `pnpm dist:mac` find it; without it a Mac build offers no output button. The ffmpeg on your PATH needs the `segment` muxer, which the usual builds have.

Environment variables for testing:

| Variable                    | Effect                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MR_STREAMER_FFMPEG`        | The ffmpeg to convert streams with, in development and packaged builds; its ffprobe must sit beside it. The tests and the marketing capture scripts read it too. |
| `MR_STREAMER_UPDATE_FEED`   | The update feed to read instead of the published one; see [releasing](../maintainers/releasing.md#testing-updates-against-another-feed).                         |
| `MR_STREAMER_UPDATE_API`    | A GitHub-compatible API for when the feed is missing, instead of `https://api.github.com`.                                                                       |
| `MR_STREAMER_UPDATE_CHECKS` | `off` stops the automatic update checks; checking from Settings still works. The packaged-app test and the measurements set it.                                  |
| `MR_STREAMER_TMDB_KEY`      | A TMDB key or read access token. At build time it's built into the app; at run time it replaces the built-in one. A key set in Settings still comes first.       |
| `MR_STREAMER_TMDB_API`      | A TMDB-compatible API instead of `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`, such as the tests' fake.                                                                        |
| `MR_STREAMER_CAST`          | `on` offers Google Cast on macOS and Linux too, where nobody has tried it.                                                                                       |
| `MR_STREAMER_AIRPLAY_LOG`   | `1` prints what the AirPlay helper says to the terminal: the record of what a receiver did.                                                                      |

## Installers

Each installer builds on its own system; the [release workflow](../maintainers/releasing.md) builds all of them. The bundled ffmpeg comes first:

```sh
apps/desktop/scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh mac-arm64   # or linux-x64, win-x64
pnpm dist:mac                                    # or dist:win, dist:msix, dist:linux; installers land in apps/desktop/dist
```

`build-ffmpeg.sh` needs a C compiler, make, nasm, pkg-config, git and curl. On Windows, open an MSYS2 **UCRT64** shell and install the build tools there:

```sh
pacman -S --needed make git curl mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-nasm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-pkgconf
```

The script rejects other MSYS2 environments and checks that GCC uses UCRT headers. FFmpeg and x264 are built together with that toolchain; MinGW-w64 support libraries and winpthreads link statically, while Windows provides UCRT. [MSYS2 recommends UCRT64](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) and deprecated MINGW64 on 15 March 2026. Linux can still cross-compile the Windows build with mingw-w64 for local diagnostics; its README records the compiler's actual C runtime, which may be MSVCRT. Release Windows binaries are built natively in UCRT64.

The script puts `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` and their licences in `apps/desktop/vendor/ffmpeg/<target>`, which electron-builder copies into the app. `README.txt` records both configure lines, the compiler, assembler and C runtime; native Windows builds also record the installed MSYS2 build-tool and UCRT64 package versions. Without the binaries, the app still builds, but streams that need converting, and every movie and episode, report that they can't be played.

A Mac build signs with a Developer ID from your keychain when one exists and notarizes when `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER` are set; see [signing](../maintainers/signing.md). Without a Developer ID, `apps/desktop/scripts/mac-ad-hoc-sign.ts` seals the app ad hoc, so a downloaded copy opens once through System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway instead of being called damaged.

## Third-party notices

Settings > About lists what the installers ship and under which licences. `pnpm build` writes the list to `apps/desktop/out/licences/third-party.json`, which electron-builder packages with the rest of `out/`. `apps/desktop/scripts/licences.ts` takes the packages whose modules ended up in the main, preload and renderer bundles, whether dependencies or devDependencies, reads their LICENSE, NOTICE and COPYING files, and adds what `apps/desktop/licences.config.json` describes:

- `packages`: packages the installers carry without a bundled module. Electron, and Tailwind for the base styles in the CSS.
- `overrides`: help for a package, with a `why`. `licence` for one that declares none, `files` to show instead of its own, or `standardText` to add the licence's standard text from `apps/desktop/licences/standard`, for a package without a licence file (with the author from its package.json) or with a notice that only refers to its licence.
- `embedded`: packages built into another package's prebuilt files and not installed, which the source maps reveal, under that package's `name@version`. Upgrading it fails the build until someone checks the entry and renames it.
- `components`: Chromium, its FFmpeg, Node.js, Microsoft's Direct3D files in Electron's Windows build, FFmpeg, x264, the MinGW-w64 runtime that the Windows ffmpeg links in, NSIS and the plug-ins of the Windows setup program, and Mr. Streamer itself, with the GPL-3.0 text from the repository's `LICENSE`. `{app}` is the version being built, `{FFMPEG_VERSION}` and `{X264_COMMIT}` come from `build-ffmpeg.sh`, `{electron}` and names such as `{CHROMIUM_FFMPEG_COMMIT}` come from `reviewed`, and the app fills `{chrome}` and `{node}` from the Electron it runs on.
- `exceptions`, on a component only: licences in its `licence` that `COMPATIBLE` doesn't list, each with the reason the installers carry the component anyway. Three components have one: Microsoft's files, which aren't open source, and two NSIS plug-ins that come without licence terms. The rest of the expression is still checked, and a package in the bundles can't take an exception.
- `reviewed`: the one version of Electron and of electron-builder that the notices and sources were checked for, with the facts recorded for it under `pins`, such as Chromium's FFmpeg revision. Under any other version the build fails; [licences](../maintainers/licences.md#upgrading-electron-or-electron-builder) has the steps of an upgrade.
- `sources`: the source archives every release attaches, each a download with its SHA-256 or a repository with a full commit hash. `apps/desktop/scripts/release-sources.ts` prepares them; see [licences](../maintainers/licences.md#sources-on-every-release).
- `installer`: the plug-ins NSIS puts in the Windows setup and in its uninstaller, by SHA-256. `apps/desktop/scripts/installer-plugins.ts` checks a built setup against it.

The build fails and lists every problem when a package declares no licence, has no licence file and no override, refers to Apache-2.0, the GPL or the LGPL without including its text, carries a package that is neither installed nor under `embedded`, or uses a licence missing from `COMPATIBLE` in `scripts/licences.ts`. Read a licence's terms before adding it there. It also fails when Electron or electron-builder isn't the version under `reviewed`, when a notice links a file on the app's release that `sources` doesn't list, and when `sources` lists a file no notice links.

Chromium's credits, which hold Node.js's licence too, are 20 MB of HTML from Electron's download: next to the executable on Linux and Windows, in the app's Resources on macOS, where `apps/desktop/scripts/mac-credits.ts` moves them. The main process turns them into plain text when the UI asks for Chromium or Node.js. `pnpm dev` serves the renderer instead of bundling it, so development shows the notices of the last `pnpm build`.

`pnpm build` also builds in the commit it comes from, `git rev-parse HEAD`, as `__BUILD_COMMIT__`. Settings > About links to that commit as the build's source. Outside a git checkout of this repository, such as an unpacked source archive, it's empty and About links only to the repository.

## Artwork

- App icons come from `apps/desktop/assets/brand/`; `pnpm --filter mrstreamer icons:export` renders `apps/desktop/build/icon.*` from `icon.svg` and the Store package's logos in `apps/desktop/build/appx` from `mark.svg` ([releasing](../maintainers/releasing.md#microsoft-store-package) lists them).
- The DMG window background is `apps/desktop/build/dmg-background.png` and its `@2x` twin; `pnpm --filter mrstreamer dmg:background` renders them on a Mac, so the text uses the system font.
- The README banner, `docs/assets/banner.png`, is 2560 × 800 for sharp screens: the mark and name, in Inter, beside Home, captured from a development build on a Mac in full screen against the fake provider with made-up channels, programmes and titles. The pictures playing in it are public domain: NASA's views of Earth from the space station on the live channel, and the U.S. National Park Service's Grand Canyon footage for the series being watched. Never use a provider's catalogue, real posters or anything not free to use worldwide in it.
- The website's pictures, `docs/assets/marketing-*.png`, are captures of the whole window at 2560 × 1600, taken on Linux by `apps/desktop/scripts/marketing-capture.ts` against a made-up subscription and the same public-domain footage. [Marketing artwork](marketing-artwork.md) has the recipe and the sources.
- The README's pictures, `docs/assets/readme-live-tv.webp`, `readme-library.webp` and `readme-watching.webp`, are 2560 × 1440 compositions on true black: the app window straight on with a thin border, and one detail of it enlarged over it. The windows are captures of a development build in the same way: the fake provider with its guide, a TMDB stand-in answering with made-up names, stories and people, and the same public-domain NASA and National Park Service footage as the banner. Only what the app shows goes in them, and the same rule holds: nothing from a real provider, film or person.
