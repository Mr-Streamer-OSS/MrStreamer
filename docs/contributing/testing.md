# Testing

The suite checks what the services promise, through their public functions, against a fake provider. Each test describes a behaviour a user or the release process depends on. This page groups the suite by behaviour and names a few files for each. The files' own `describe` and `it` names list every case, and `pnpm vitest list` prints them all.

## Running the suite

```sh
pnpm test                                                              # every test file
pnpm vitest run apps/desktop/test/receiver.test.ts --reporter=verbose  # one file, with each test's time
pnpm vitest run -t "a segment away from the start"                     # tests whose names match
pnpm vitest list --filesOnly                                           # the files a run takes
```

[`test/suites.ts`](../../test/suites.ts) says where test files live: `*.test.ts` under `test/`, `packages/*/test/` and `apps/*/test/`. Vitest runs every one, and [CI](#ci) requires every one in its report, so a new test file needs no list of its own. CI's Check job runs `pnpm knip`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm fmt:check`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build`.

Eight files need `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`: `playback`, `titles`, `receiver`, `output`, `playlist-playback`, `title-filter-playback`, `online-subtitle-playback` and `downloads` in `apps/desktop/test`. They use the ones on PATH, or `MR_STREAMER_FFMPEG` and the ffprobe beside it, and skip their media groups without them. That skip is for a laptop: CI installs both and fails a run where any of them skipped. The setup wizard's test types into a terminal that util-linux's `script` makes, so it runs on Linux and skips elsewhere. `airplay-helper-key.test.ts` runs only on macOS. Tests that run a workflow's bash step skip on Windows.

## What the suite covers

The groups below say what each part of the suite holds the app to, and where to start reading. A change to one of these behaviours belongs in the files named, or beside them.

### Subscriptions and logins

[`subscription`](../../apps/desktop/test/subscription.test.ts), [`playlist`](../../apps/desktop/test/playlist.test.ts), [`credentials`](../../apps/desktop/test/credentials.test.ts) and [`roster`](../../apps/desktop/test/roster.test.ts) run the main process's services against the fake provider and playlist host. A login or a playlist link never reaches the registry, an error the window gets or the diagnostics log. An https address never falls back to http unless the viewer agrees in the Connect screen. The profile is shared with the stable release: `subscription.json` as stable writes it, a write cut short between two files, a damaged registry, and a keychain that lost a secret, which asks again naming only the host. Removing a subscription stops its stream first, takes what was loaded from it and leaves every other one alone, also when two providers number everything alike. In the renderer, `connect`, `subscription-section`, `remove-subscription` and `several-subscriptions` cover the same paths through Settings and the Connect screen.

### Lists, metadata and search

[`library`](../../apps/desktop/test/library.test.ts), [`ondemand`](../../apps/desktop/test/ondemand.test.ts), [`metadata`](../../apps/desktop/test/metadata.test.ts), `playlist-import`, `playlist-limits`, `live-search-library`, `related` and `title-filters` in `apps/desktop/test`, with the pure rules in `packages/core/test` (`catalogue`, `ondemand`, `playlist`, `playlist-import`, `text`, `live-search`, `related`, `title-filters`, `version-options`). Lists survive restarts, and a failed, empty or short refresh keeps what was there. Titles for adults show only while Settings shows them. A film several subscriptions list is one title, joined by its TMDB id and never by a provider's id or a name. TMDB is asked about a title once, in the viewer's language. A mapped playlist imports 100,000 entries and refuses one more. The renderer files for Live TV search, the title grid, filters, version menus, episode rows and details hold what the viewer sees and which keys reach it.

### Guide

[`packages/core/test/guide.test.ts`](../../packages/core/test/guide.test.ts) reads XMLTV as it arrives, in pieces, packed and under the limits in `packages/core/src/guide/limits.ts`. [`guide`](../../apps/desktop/test/guide.test.ts) and [`guide-source`](../../apps/desktop/test/guide-source.test.ts) cover six-hourly refreshes, failed downloads that keep the guide in use, several subscriptions sharing guide ids, and a guide address of the viewer's own: sealed, with only its host shown, and channels mapped by hand through restarts. `renderer/guide-map` covers the Map sheet.

### Favourites, history and marks

[`viewing`](../../apps/desktop/test/viewing.test.ts), [`episode-marks`](../../apps/desktop/test/episode-marks.test.ts), [`watchlist`](../../apps/desktop/test/watchlist.test.ts), `preferences` and `verified-files`, with `packages/core/test/episodes.test.ts` for the rules of where a series goes on. Favourites, history, progress, marks and the watchlist survive restarts and add up the same when rebuilt from their events. Files older builds wrote still read. A database that fails partway stores nothing and the retry does it. Erasing an account's record erases only its own. A mark holds against a play begun before it and gives way to one begun after. The renderer files `resume`, `next-episode`, `episode-marks`, `watchlist`, `details-remove` and `favourite-order` cover the buttons, keys and countdowns over that record.

### Playback, titles and receivers

These need ffmpeg and ffprobe. [`playback`](../../apps/desktop/test/playback.test.ts) runs the local proxy and checks what the player receives for each codec clip, passed through or converted, with its sound and subtitle tracks. [`titles`](../../apps/desktop/test/titles.test.ts) plays movies and episodes from providers with and without byte ranges, with the same decoded picture and start time from either, on one connection to the provider. [`receiver`](../../apps/desktop/test/receiver.test.ts) plays the TV's part: playlists and segments cut at uneven keyframes, and a segment's 30-second deadline. [`output`](../../apps/desktop/test/output.test.ts), [`cast`](../../apps/desktop/test/cast.test.ts) and [`airplay`](../../apps/desktop/test/airplay.test.ts) hand playback to a stand-in Cast device, held to Chromium's schema, and a stand-in AirPlay helper, and leave no process behind. `playlist-playback` and `title-filter-playback` follow a playlist's file and a title's tracks through real playback. Throughout, nothing opens once the viewer moved on or the login changed. The renderer's `receiver`, `receiver-playback`, `output-chooser`, `media-session` and `mini-player` cover the window's side.

### Live player and recovery

The renderer's [`live-recovery`](../../apps/desktop/test/renderer/live-recovery.test.ts) holds a failing channel to reconnects after 1, 2, 4 and 8 seconds, at most four while it only comes back for a moment, never two streams open, and no provider's words or addresses on screen. `paused-recovery`, `title-reading-ahead`, `hls-errors`, `channel-tracks`, `speed-menu`, `live-quality`, `live-more` and `title-scrubber-keys` cover a paused movie letting go of the provider, the player's watchdog deadlines, HLS errors that keep the picture, and the player's keys and menus.

### Subtitles

`packages/core/test/subtitles.test.ts`, `subtitle-presence` and `subtitle-text-file` decode teletext, DVB, captions, SubRip and WebVTT. In the player, picture and text subtitles show at a position however long ago they began, new text never waits behind the recovery of earlier lines, and the 35-second deadline leaves text showing (`titles`, `renderer/title-subtitles`). HLS and live subtitle tracks are offered only once a stream proves them (`renderer/hls-tracks`, `live-hls-availability`, `live-subtitle-availability`). Online subtitles (`online-subtitles`, `online-subtitle-playback`, `saved-subtitles`, `subtitle-services`, `subtitle-accounts`, `renderer/online-subtitle-panel`, `renderer/downloaded-subtitles`) make no request until asked, belong to the exact file they were chosen for, survive restarts and keep a service's credentials sealed and out of every error.

### Downloads

[`downloads`](../../apps/desktop/test/downloads.test.ts) needs ffmpeg and ffprobe and runs the main process against the fake provider and a disk that fails as a full or missing one does. A finished download matches the source byte for byte and plays with no provider request. A partial file resumes only when the provider proves it is the same file, and starts again when it was replaced or ranges are ignored. Cancel, retry, deletion, shutdown and subtitles kept with their file are covered too. `renderer/downloads` covers the Downloads page and the top bar's notice of a download. The built-app and memory checks are in [Packaged app](#packaged-app) and the [Downloads feature entry](../../.cursor/skills/verify-mrstreamer/features/downloads.md).

### Interface language

`packages/core/test/i18n.test.ts` has every message in every language with all its values, plurals by each language's rules, and English for a message a language lacks. `preferences` keeps the choice through restarts and a later release's value, `menu` builds the macOS menu bar in it, and `renderer/interface-language` changes the window's text at once. These see DOM text, not painted pixels; the [Language feature entry](../../.cursor/skills/verify-mrstreamer/features/language.md) covers the built app, and an installed Mac build is checked by eye.

### Updates and diagnostics

[`updates`](../../apps/desktop/test/updates.test.ts) covers channels, the feed with GitHub as its fallback, the four-hourly check and its backoff, and checks that answer late. `installer` drives a stand-in for electron-updater through cancelling at every step. Neither installs anything: an update of an installed app is checked by hand on a nightly. `diagnostics` and `diagnostics-export` keep addresses, logins and channel names out of the log and its export. The renderer's `update-check`, `version-menu` and `about` cover Settings.

### Release, packaging and CI

[`test/release.test.ts`](../../test/release.test.ts) covers version order, when a nightly is due, which commit a stable release builds and the update feed. [`release-workflow`](../../test/release-workflow.test.ts), [`marketing-workflow`](../../test/marketing-workflow.test.ts) and [`ci-test-results`](../../test/ci-test-results.test.ts) read the workflows and run their bash steps and scripts against repositories made for them: artifact names kept apart across a stable run's two releases, an older tested nightly built under main's workflow, the Store job's reach and credential, the website's publication gate, and the completeness of CI's test report. `store-release`, `store-submission` (against a stand-in for Microsoft), `zip` and `setup-microsoft-store` cover the Store tooling. In `apps/desktop/test`, `licences`, `release-sources`, `msix`, `mac-release-phases` and `airplay-helper-key` cover notices, source archives, Store package versions, timing a Mac release step and the AirPlay helper's cache key, and `measurement` and `measurement-cli` the [measurement tools](#app-measurements).

### Website

`apps/marketing/test` covers the download button each system gets, the installers the update feed names, the home page under its stylesheet, release history, and the public document pages without JavaScript.

### Renderer tests

The renderer's controllers and hooks run in `apps/desktop/test/renderer`, with happy-dom for a DOM and `support.ts` in place of the main process: it records each call, answers the preferences, and holds a call until the test answers it. It stands in for Media Source Extensions too, which happy-dom lacks, with a source that opens and takes no data, so a title's run gets as far as its subtitles. A live stream plays in the element's own engine there: a test moves the element's clock for a picture that moves, and sends the element's `error` event for a stream that stops, with a stand-in for `MediaError`, which happy-dom lacks too. happy-dom refuses a text track's hidden mode and times no cues, so `support.ts` lets a hidden track list its cues, and a test moves the element's clock and sends `seeked` itself. They test what the viewer would see, and media playback does nothing there. hls.js plays nothing there either, so `hls-stand-in.ts` takes its place for the tests of an HLS channel's tracks: it keeps what hls.js promises about renditions, groups, the lines it reads and the segments it says it read, and the [playlist test](#packaged-app) checks the real one in a built app. Where a test needs a run to get further, it puts a stand-in for the title engine that keeps the engine's promises: a run started paused holds its picture. The renderer's tsconfig checks them.

## Deadlines on a busy machine

Vitest ends a test that takes longer than its allowance, 5 seconds unless a suite or a test names another. The title tests and the tests of a movie for a receiver have 20 seconds, and two of the receiver's have 15 of their own. The tests of episode marks on disk have 20 seconds too, since each starts the app twice. The allowance covers the whole test: connecting the fake provider, every ffmpeg and ffprobe the test starts, and the waits between them. It is not what a test holds the proxy to. Where the proxy must answer in time, the test sets that wait itself, `segmentMs` or `cuesMs` in place of the app's 30 and 15 seconds, and asserts how long the answer took. Those numbers are the same whatever the allowance.

The tests of a movie for a receiver have 20 seconds because most of their time goes to starting processes and waiting for the provider's connection, and both take longer on a busy machine. One test starts ffmpeg or ffprobe 1 to 10 times, about a tenth of a second each with Ubuntu's build. The fake provider frees its one connection 50 ms after a request closes, so the request that follows is refused and the proxy asks again 150 ms later, up to 14 times in one test. Leaving out the two with 15 seconds of their own, the slowest takes 2.4 seconds on GitHub's four-processor runners. On a 12-processor virtual machine shared with other work the slowest took 4.3 seconds at a load average of 5, and at a load of 10 to 16 some needed more than the 5 seconds they had then.

When `Test timed out` shows in those two files, look at the machine before running the suite again. `uptime` gives the load. `pnpm vitest run apps/desktop/test/receiver.test.ts --reporter=verbose` runs one file and prints every test's time. On a busy machine most tests are slow by about the same factor. A change that slows every run looks the same, so run the file again once the machine is quiet and compare with the times above. One test far beyond the rest points at that test or the code it covers.

ffmpeg 6, which Ubuntu 24.04 and CI install, switches threads for every packet it copies from a single input, and a virtual machine makes each switch expensive. Copying the 60,000 packets of the large-file test took it 9 to 49 seconds on that machine, 2 with `taskset -c 0` in front, and 1 with `-thread_queue_size 64`. That is why the app passes the option when it reads a title's file, and why the test makes its large file with one. `perf bench sched pipe -T` measures what a switch costs: 35 µs for a round trip there, 12 with both threads on one processor.

## Fake provider and codec clips

`apps/desktop/test/fake-provider.ts` answers like an Xtream Codes panel, with the untidiness of real ones: prefixed names, separator entries, numbers sent as strings, missing logos, one connection at a time. Tests can make catalogue requests fail or change the channels it lists. With `adultChannels`, it adds channels for adults: one the provider flags in an ordinary category, and two in a category named for adults. About half its channels have a guide id, shared by variants of one channel, and `xmltv.php` serves half-hour programmes around the current time. Tests can replace that document, fail it, hold it open or send it in pieces of a few bytes, and count guide and stream requests. Its "TEST | Formats and failures" category streams the clips in `test/fixtures`, plus an offline channel. Its last category, "BE | Kwaliteit", lists one channel in Full HD, HD and SD, the Full HD stream off air.

It lists 120 movies and series by default, in their own categories, one of them for adults; one series is marked for adults in an ordinary category. Each carries a TMDB id, its id plus 10,000, except every seventh movie, which has none, and "TEST | Two sound tracks and subtitles 1080p (NL AUDIO)", which shares the MULTI film's and plays the MP4 clip: one film in two versions. "TEST | Formats (EN)" shares the "TEST | Formats (NL)" series' id and lists two of its episodes: one series in two versions. Their files redirect to another address and answer byte ranges, with an ETag, and each open file holds a connection slot. A test can put another file behind a movie's address, give a file another ETag with every answer, have two servers with their own ETags take turns, mark answers with the time they were sent instead, make the provider wait in the middle of a file or before a part that names its end, or have it answer every request with the whole file, as a provider without byte ranges does. The "TEST" movies and the "TEST | Formats" series play the title clips, and one test movie has no file; the rest play the MP4 clip. Tests can fail the lists, or answer them with a refused login as panels do, change what they list as a panel's updates do, with titles dropped, renamed or listed under another id or TMDB id (`serveTitles`), and count file and details requests.

With `second`, it is another provider beside that one, for the tests of several subscriptions: its panel numbers everything as the first's does, so the same id means something else at each. Its channels are the first's, as many as it is asked for, under the same ids and names. Its "TEST" movies are the same films under the same ids, with the TMDB ids the first sends, so each is one title with a version of either. Of its other movies, every second one is the first's next film in English, so under another id than it has there, with the TMDB id the first sends for it, or "0" where the first sends none; the rest are films of its own, "Other Story", with TMDB ids of their own. Its "TEST | Formats (DE)" is the first's series by its TMDB id, with one season of two episodes under the first's own series and episode ids, and its other series are its own.

`apps/desktop/test/fake-playlist.ts` is a playlist host, as a public collection publishes one: an M3U link without a login, three HLS channels, and a guide its first line names only once a test says so. "TEST | Two sounds and subtitles" plays `test/fixtures/hls`, which `apps/desktop/scripts/hls-fixtures.ts` writes with the ffmpeg on PATH: sixteen seconds of test picture in four segments, an English sound rendition at 440 Hz and one at 660 Hz that the stream names only "spa", and English and German WebVTT subtitles, the English ones marked as the stream's default, each with a numbered line from 0.25 to 1.75 s into every two seconds, and French ones that are a header without a line, as broadcasters send while nothing is subtitled. "TEST | Captions in the picture" declares nothing and plays the subtitle channel clip, whose picture carries "HELLO CAPTIONS"; "TEST | One sound" has nothing to choose. Every stream ends, so a line shows at the same second each time it plays.

`apps/desktop/test/fake-guide-host.ts` is a host for XMLTV guides at addresses of their own, apart from any provider, as a guide service publishes them: one file behind an address that carries a key. A test says what each path answers: a document, plain or packed, whole or in pieces of a few bytes, with headers of its own; an HTTP status that fails it; a redirect; or nothing until the test lets go. It notes every request with its headers, so a test can tell that the key went nowhere but there and that nothing of a provider's login came along.

`apps/desktop/test/fake-tmdb.ts` stands in for TMDB: every title it's asked about exists, a comedy when its id is odd and a drama when even, made in Dutch when the id divides by three and in English otherwise. Its names follow the id too (`tmdbName`): English translates all but every fifth title, Dutch all but every seventh, and other languages nothing, so the original name comes back as TMDB sends it. It lists two streaming services, Netflix and Videoland; tests set what Netflix carries, make it refuse every key, and count detail requests, and those a title's details make as it opens, which also get a story, a poster and credits. Every series has two seasons, four episodes in the first and one in the second, named in the series' own language and in Dutch, in English when the episode's number is odd, and "Episode 2" otherwise, as TMDB answers; tests count season requests by series, season and language, and make them fail or never answer. `support.ts` starts services without a key unless a test gives one.

The clips in `apps/desktop/test/fixtures` are generated, never recorded from a real channel. Three seconds of test picture and tone, 128 × 72:

```sh
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i smptebars=size=128x72:rate=25 -f lavfi -i sine=frequency=440:sample_rate=48000 -t 3 \

`apps/desktop/scripts/subtitle-fixtures.ts` writes the subtitle clips with the ffmpeg on PATH: `title-h264-picture-subs.mkv`, `title-long-subs.mkv` and its two variants, `recording-long-subtitles.mpegts` and `title-caption-track.mov` above, and `h264-subtitles.mpegts`, four seconds of a channel with English and Dutch sound, Dutch DVB subtitles from 0.5 to 3 s, teletext page 888 in Dutch from 1 to 3 s, and closed captions in the picture from 1 to 3 s. It draws the text with a pixel font of its own and writes teletext and captions from their specifications, so nothing comes from a real broadcast. FFmpeg's decoders and libzvbi read every one back: the DVB, DVD and PGS pictures, "TELETEKST 888" and "HELLO CAPTIONS". The fake provider streams the channel as "TEST | Subtitles and two sound tracks", and as the movie "TEST | Broadcast recording"; "TEST | Picture subtitles" plays the title clip.

## Receivers

No suite needs a TV. `apps/desktop/test/fake-cast-receiver.ts` is a Cast device on loopback: it reads every frame with protobufjs and Chromium's `cast_channel.proto` (`test/fixtures/cast`, under the BSD licence beside it), so the app's own framing is held to the schema, and tests make it refuse, stay silent, drop the connection or send frames in parts. `fake-airplay-helper.mjs` stands in for the Swift helper and speaks its lines; `fake-airplay-helper.ts` drives it. The receiver suite plays the part of the TV itself, asking the served address for playlists and segments over HTTP and reading the segments' timestamps.

`title-receiver.mkv` and `title-receiver.mp4` come from `apps/desktop/scripts/receiver-fixtures.ts`: 64 s with keyframes at uneven distances, some half a second apart, B-frames, two sound tracks and English SubRip subtitles, one of which lasts across a keyframe. The MKV's clock starts at 7.5 s; the MP4 keeps its index at the end and shows its first picture a frame after zero. `test/matroska-index.ts` rewrites an MKV's index to leave keyframes out or name one that isn't there.

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/cast-tv.ts` runs the whole Cast path through a built app's window, by hand: the app finds the fake device by mDNS on this computer's own local network address, connects, and the device fetches what it is sent as a TV's player would. It plays a movie here, tries a TV that refuses, moves the movie to the TV, pauses and skips it there, leaves the player, brings it back with Play here, moves a channel over, pauses that with the TV's own remote and lets its stream run dry, and quits. On Linux with a session bus, as `dbus-run-session -- xvfb-run …` gives it one, it also sends the system's Play over MPRIS, as a media key does, and the TV has to play the paused channel on without a new load. It needs a private address on an interface that isn't a tunnel, `openssl` and `ffprobe`. From `apps/desktop`, after `pnpm build`:

```sh
xvfb-run -a node test/e2e/cast-tv.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- . --no-sandbox
```

A Linux machine without such a network can make one that touches nothing else, in a network namespace:

```sh
sudo ip netns add tv
sudo ip netns exec tv ip link set lo up
sudo ip netns exec tv ip link add eth0 type dummy
sudo ip netns exec tv ip addr add 192.168.77.1/24 dev eth0
sudo ip netns exec tv ip link set eth0 multicast on up
sudo ip netns exec tv ip route add 224.0.0.0/4 dev eth0
sudo ip netns exec tv sudo -u "$USER" env PATH="$PATH" HOME="$HOME" \
  xvfb-run -a node test/e2e/cast-tv.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- . --no-sandbox
sudo ip netns delete tv
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/airplay-tv.ts` runs AirPlay through a development build's window on a Mac, by hand, and closes that window while the TV plays: only macOS keeps the app running without its window. The TV is the stand-in helper. The app looks for its helper in its own folder, so the script starts the built app from a folder it makes, with the stand-in in the helper's place, and plays the system, the viewer at Apple's list and the TV, which fetches what it is sent from the app's local network address. The window closes as from its close button, `BrowserWindow.close` through the main process's inspector, and comes back by the event a click on the Dock icon sends. It checks that:

- closing the window while playback is here ends the stream and a connect still under way, and the Dock opens a new window
- closing it while the TV plays keeps its page, which pauses and plays the TV and tells the system so, while the app serves the TV on the one connection
- the next episode starts on the TV ten seconds after the end, with the window closed for over a minute by then
- the Dock brings the same window back, and there is one
- a full-screen window leaves full screen as it goes out of sight
- a TV that lets go with the window closed closes it, and nothing plays here
- quitting with the window closed ends the TV's playback and the app, within 10 s, and nothing holds the provider's connection two seconds on

```sh
node test/e2e/airplay-tv.ts node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/airplay-list.ts` runs the same way and checks where the app asks for Apple's list and when it takes it back, which depend on the real window. For the viewer who goes to another app it brings Finder to the front with `open`, and the app back through the inspector. It checks that:

- O asks for the list at the output button's place on screen, also with the page zoomed
- from the mini player the window goes back first, and the list is asked for at the button it then shows and stays up
- from a mini player that was full screen the window fills the screen again first, and the list is asked for at the button it then shows and stays up
- P while an O still waits for the window leaves the mini player and no list, and P again fills the screen
- a list asked for as the window goes full screen, and given up before the window settled, opens none once it has, from here and with Play here from a TV that plays, and the O after it opens one
- a list asked for by name as the window goes full screen, and taken back by that name, opens none once the window has settled, while another list's name leaves it to open, and its own then takes it down with the episode playing on here
- a list asked for as the window goes full screen opens none once the viewer went to another app before the window settled, with the TV playing on, and the O after the viewer is back opens one, which stays up when its window loses the keyboard
- a window that moves takes its list down, and what plays here plays on
- a window minimised or closed while the TV plays takes its list down, and the TV plays on from the same helper and the same address
- a window out of sight opens no list

```sh
node test/e2e/airplay-list.ts node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron
```

The stand-in shows no list, so this says nothing of the list itself. `airplay-tv.ts` takes about three minutes. One of them is a wait with the window closed, because Chromium slows a hidden page's timers to one a minute only after the first. A build that leaves the page throttled fails the next-episode check. It runs with `--use-mock-keychain` and a throwaway profile. It doesn't press the system's media keys, which go to whatever plays on the Mac, and reads what the page tells the system instead. `cast-tv.ts` doesn't run on a Mac reached over SSH, where macOS refuses multicast to programs started that way and the app's mDNS query never leaves.

The real helper is checked on a Mac: `scripts/build-airplay-helper.sh mac-arm64`, then run it with nothing to read, and it says `hello` and exits. No suite opens Apple's list. How the helper opens and closes it was tried on one Mac by sending the helper the app's lines and reading its windows from the window server; a click inside the list needs a person. The same reading, with a development build's window in full screen, showed the list over the window's Space, and from a mini player that was full screen at the button and still up after the window filled the screen again. What nothing here covers is a receiver itself: discovery on a real network, the Windows firewall, what a TV's player accepts and how it behaves over hours. Nor does anything press a media key on macOS or Windows, or restart into an update with the window out of sight. Those are tried by hand on a nightly, and the [project](https://github.com/orgs/Mr-Streamer-OSS/projects/1) card holds the result.

A press inside the list needs a person at a Mac with a receiver on its network. The helper hears the presses macOS gives to other processes and takes one for the viewer leaving, unless the pointer is over the list. Whether macOS tells it of a press on the list's rows at all is untried, and so is that exception. On a nightly started from a terminal with `MR_STREAMER_AIRPLAY_LOG=1`, check by hand that:

- the list stays up after a press on Show more, with the hand off the mouse
- a receiver picked in it takes the list down, and the app has the keyboard again
- a press outside the list closes it
- Command-Tab to another app closes it, and that app stays in front
- after each of those the button opens the list on the first press

The helper's lines say of each press it heard `A press at the list, which stays up.` or `A press in another app, so the list closes.`, and nothing of what was pressed.

## Packaged app

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/packaged-app.ts` starts a built app with a throwaway profile, connects it to the fake provider through the login form, and checks who updates it: the Microsoft Store for an installed MSIX, which runs from `WindowsApps`, the app itself for every other build. Then it plays a channel that passes straight through and one the bundled ffmpeg converts. Then it leaves Watch for Home and watches again from there. Then it opens a movie from Movies' All movies tab, which the bundled ffprobe reads and ffmpeg repackages, skips 10 seconds ahead and leaves. Then it plays the movie with picture subtitles and chooses its English PGS, then its Dutch DVD subtitles, which the bundled ffmpeg sends beside the picture, and, paused, starts it again inside a PGS subtitle and after a DVD one. Then it chooses the movie's French subtitles, which are text, inside their line, which it gives a WebVTT class that the app's styles hide things with, and skips past it. Last, it opens Chromium's and Node.js's notices, which Settings > About reads from the credits page the installer keeps. It passes when the build names the right updater, both channels show a moving picture with decoded sound, Home plays the same stream muted while Watch plays it with sound, without another request to the provider, the movie plays with sound, skips and holds no connection once left, both subtitle tracks draw over the picture while due, a subtitle that began before the position a run starts from shows once it has loaded and one that ended before it doesn't, the text subtitle shows its line in place of the pictures, readable whatever its class, and nothing after the skip, and both notices have text.

```sh
node apps/desktop/test/e2e/packaged-app.ts "/Applications/Mr. Streamer.app/Contents/MacOS/Mr. Streamer" -- --use-mock-keychain
node apps/desktop/test/e2e/packaged-app.ts "$LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\mrstreamer\Mr. Streamer.exe"

xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/packaged-app.ts "/opt/Mr. Streamer/mrstreamer" -- --no-sandbox
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/playlist-app.ts` takes the same arguments and checks a playlist subscription against the fake playlist host, where the suite can't: hls.js needs a real browser. It connects by the M3U link and passes when Settings > Subscriptions says "none in this playlist" without an error, also after its refresh, shows the guide once the playlist names one and drops it again; the channel with two sound renditions lists both under Sound and its subtitles under CC, with no subtitles on though the stream marks some as its default; picking the other sound loads that rendition's segments and decodes sound while the same stream plays on; subtitles without a line stop saying Loading once hls.js has read them; the chosen subtitles' line shows at its second, C turns them off and on again with the lines read before; the captions channel offers and shows its captions, and after Stop and the same channel again they are still chosen and their line shows once; the first channel then starts with the sound and subtitles in the languages picked; a stream with nothing to choose shows neither button; and after the profile's sealed link is spoiled, as a reset keychain leaves it, the app opens on what it had loaded, Settings > Subscriptions says the playlist needs its link again and asks for it on its row, naming only its host, and the same link is taken for the same subscription, with its favourite. It needs no sound device: sound counts when the element decodes it. Run it by hand after a change to playlists or the HLS player; the release workflow doesn't.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/playlist-app.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/live-recovery-app.ts` takes the same arguments and checks what a live channel does when its stream fails, where the real player, the proxy and a provider that counts its connections meet. Its provider allows one connection and sends three seconds of picture, after which the script has it stall, end the stream or answer with nothing. It passes when Automatic passes the quality that is off air and the quality menu says "No stream · 404" on that row and "Playing" on the next; the offline channel says "No stream right now" with HTTP 404, R asks the provider once more and nothing asks again by itself; with the connection held from outside the app, the channel says "Refused by the provider" with HTTP 403 after three requests and no more, offers Retry and Channels only, and plays with R once the connection is free; a stream that ends a few seconds after every start is opened five times, never two at once, then says "Keeps dropping" and nothing is asked for in the twelve seconds after; and a picture that stands still says "Waiting for data", the channel reconnects, and Stop during the wait before the third reconnect leaves no stream opened after it. It takes about two minutes. Run it by hand after a change to live playback or its recovery; the release workflow doesn't.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/live-recovery-app.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/favourite-order.ts` takes the same arguments and checks reordering the favourites against the fake provider, where the suite can't: happy-dom lays nothing out, scrolls nothing and moves no real focus. It stars forty channels, one of them in three qualities, one for adults and one the provider doesn't list, and passes when Reorder leaves a search alone until its link clears it; R starts with the focus on a row; a real click moves a row one place and with Shift to the bottom, in view and in focus; the keys move the selection, and with Alt the channel, by one place, ten or to an end; a row the wheel scrolled out of view keeps the focus, and its next move shows it; Tab reaches a row's buttons and Space presses them; Escape drops the draft; Enter saves, with the hidden favourites where they were; a save while another writer holds the database fails, keeps the draft and saves on Retry; favourites changed behind the page are read again on Reload; a favourite starred meanwhile ends the draft; Home's row, Watch's list and channel up and down follow the order; nothing asked the provider for a stream before a channel was watched; and the order holds after a new catalogue and a restart.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/favourite-order.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/watchlist-app.ts` takes the same arguments and checks the watchlist against two fake providers and the fake TMDB, where the suite can't: happy-dom lays nothing out, moves no real focus and plays nothing. With the first provider's subscription alone, it passes when the top bar has Watchlist and its empty page says how to save; a real click on Save in a movie's details saves it and the button reads Saved; Tab reaches Save from Play in a series' details, Space saves, Enter takes it off again and the button keeps the focus; a film in two versions is one entry; the page counts and shows what is saved newest first and by name, the arrow keys and Enter open a title, and Home's row leads there; a saved movie plays and resumes from its details on one connection to the provider, lets go of it, and stays saved; Tab reaches a tile's cross, Enter removes the title and a cross keeps the focus; a save while another writer holds the database says it couldn't, keeps Save and saves on the next press; Save pressed twice in one task, before the window drew the first press, makes one change, as Saved does, and keeps the focus; a title the provider drops says Unavailable, opens a sheet with Remove alone, opens its details again once the provider lists it, and goes with Enter on that Remove; a saved title for adults shows and counts only while Settings shows them; the sheet of one the provider dropped, left open under Settings, is gone once Settings hides them, its name drawn nowhere after, and it is still saved; and everything is there after a restart. Then it adds the second provider in Settings > Subscriptions, which lists one of the first's films under an id of its own, and passes when Movies shows that film once; a click on Save saves it for both subscriptions as one change, with no question or menu opened, and one tile that names neither; the second's version, picked in Play's menu, asks the second's provider alone for the file, on one connection, and how far it got is kept for that version alone; the tile's cross takes it off for both; removing the second subscription leaves the first's entries and the film both saved, takes the second's own entry out, and keeps its account's rows in the database, which adding it again brings back under its new id; removing it with the box ticked leaves one account in the database and the rest as it was; and removing the last subscription keeps its watchlist for the account's return and deletes it with its box ticked. It needs `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, blocks the picture hosts so nothing leaves the machine, and takes about a minute and a half. Run it by hand after a change to the watchlist, the title sheets or the collection grid; the release workflow doesn't.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/watchlist-app.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/episode-marks.ts` takes the same arguments and checks marking episodes against two fake providers and the fake TMDB, where the suite can't: happy-dom moves no real focus and keeps no database between starts. It plays nothing, so it needs neither ffmpeg nor ffprobe. With the first provider's subscription alone, it passes when Tab reaches an episode's dots from its row, Enter opens them and the arrow keys and Enter mark the episode watched, with the keyboard still on the dots, the row checked, Undo offered, Play moved on to the next episode, and no file or stream asked of the provider; a real click on Undo puts the episode and Play back; a real click on the dots marks without playing; an episode stopped partway offers both marks, loses its resume point when marked unwatched, keeps its mark and its Undo when the play that was going saves how far it got, and has Resume back with the same time left after Undo; after a restart the marks are in the details and on Home's Continue watching, which offers the episode the details' Play names; and when the provider takes that episode out of the series, the details go on with the next one once they are opened again, and so does Home. With the second provider added, which lists the series under the same ids, it passes when its version shows none of the first's checks, the dots and the line name the subscription, a mark made there is in its own record alone, and taking it back leaves the first's.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/episode-marks.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/multiple-subscriptions.ts` takes the same arguments and checks several subscriptions, where the window, the player, the catalogue worker and the main process meet: two fake providers whose panels number everything alike, the second started with `second`, and the fake TMDB. It connects the first and passes when search names it on no row; a second is added in Settings > Subscriptions while a channel of the first plays, with no new request for that stream and its row saying what plays; a subscription renamed there is listed under its new name; search finds a channel both list twice, each naming its subscription, and a channel only one lists on its own row, which names its subscription; watching the other subscription's channel leaves the first provider with no stream open and the second with one; a film both list under different ids is one tile, while the same id at each stays two films, Play's menu names each version's subscription, the one picked asks its own provider for the file and no other, and the other's version then offers no Resume; a series both list shows one season of two episodes for the second's version, though the first lists two seasons under the same id; favourites of both show as one list, each row naming its subscription, with a programme from its own guide, and the keys send the first to the end past the other subscription's; a restart keeps both, their ids, names, lists and that order, with the added one in its own folder; removing the one that plays says what stops and which stays, closes its stream, takes its channels, favourites and folder away and leaves the first's login, Home resumes a moving preview from the remaining provider after the removed channel was recorded as watched, adding it again brings its favourite back under a new id, removing a provider that plays nothing preserves the preview without another stream request; and removing both returns to Connect with no stream open and no login saved. It takes about two minutes. Run it by hand after a change to subscriptions, to how their lists are put together, or to which stream plays; the release workflow doesn't.

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/guide-source.ts` takes the same arguments and checks a guide from an address of the viewer's own, against the fake provider and the fake guide host. It connects, plays a channel, and passes when Settings > Subscriptions checks an address without changing the guide and switches to it on Use this guide, with the channel on the one connection it had and nothing of the address shown or saved but its host; the channels the guide lists show its programmes; the keyboard maps a channel without programmes to the guide channel picked in the Map sheet, on that same connection still, and the channel moves from those without programmes to those mapped by hand; a download that fails keeps the guide, says why under the Guide row and asks the provider for nothing; a restart keeps the address, the mapping, the listings and the failure, with nothing asked of the guide's host; and Use provider guide goes back, with the address, its guide and the mapping gone from the profile.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/multiple-subscriptions.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
node apps/desktop/test/e2e/multiple-subscriptions.ts node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron -- --use-mock-keychain "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

`--use-mock-keychain` keeps a macOS run away from the real Keychain. Without FUSE, run an AppImage with `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` in the environment. A development build runs it too, after `pnpm build`: `xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/packaged-app.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD"`.

`apps/desktop/test/e2e/live-subtitle-errors-app.ts` uses the built app and a loopback HLS host. It checks missing and stalled subtitle playlists and segments with moving video; six-second sliding playlists with delayed picture, a remembered language, racing Off and language switches, and initially empty subtitles; a real one-time selected segment 404 and repeated 503s keeping the language selected until cues resume; IMSC fallback; and CC left off for forty seconds with dead subtitle playlists or segments, with bounded requests and no video cancellations after the initial probe. A later genuine video stall must still reconnect. It needs ffmpeg and ffprobe. `MR_STREAMER_SUBTITLE_ERRORS_ONLY` selects comma-separated modes when investigating a failure.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/live-subtitle-errors-app.ts node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

Downloads have service contracts in `apps/desktop/test/downloads.test.ts`, against the fake provider and a disk that can fail as a full or missing one does, and renderer contracts in `test/renderer/downloads.test.ts`. The built-app proof is `xvfb-run -a pnpm verify:desktop downloads`, or `downloads fr-FR` for the same path in French, described in the [Downloads feature entry](../../.cursor/skills/verify-mrstreamer/features/downloads.md): three starts on one profile, the second with the fake provider and TMDB stopped, the third with no subscription saved, and every outbound connection of main and the window recorded. `apps/desktop/test/e2e/download-memory.ts` measures what a transfer holds in memory, through the app's transfer and the real file system, against a file generated in another process: ranged to the end, cancelled, resumed, replaced, with ranges ignored, and a disk that fills midway, each finished file checked byte for byte. On a Linux VPS a 2 GiB file kept the process within 92 MiB above its start in every case, as a 256 MiB file did; it writes about 10 GB to the temporary folder.

```sh
node apps/desktop/test/e2e/download-memory.ts 2048 .local/download-memory.json
```

## A real provider

The suite, the packaged-app test and the measurements run against the fakes and always will. They must answer the same way every time and offline, and no public provider offers what they exercise: an Xtream API, movies and series, failures on demand, or clips in every format.

Live TV also gets checked in the real app against a real provider: iptv-org's public playlist of channels broadcasters stream for free. It needs no login. On the Connect screen, choose **Use an M3U link** and paste this link, browse Live TV, then play several https and http channels, switch between them, restart and play again:

```
https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u
```

`pnpm start` runs the development build after `pnpm build`. On Linux without a display, `xvfb-run -a node_modules/electron/dist/electron --no-sandbox --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=<throwaway folder> apps/desktop` runs it with a fresh profile and a DevTools port to drive it, as `test/e2e/app.ts` does.

The whole list has about 11,000 channels and loads in about a second. A country's is shorter, as `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/us.m3u` or `.../uk.m3u`. Broadcasters' own streams are the steadiest: France 24, DW, NHK World, Das Erste, Rai and NBC News NOW all played from France on 2 October 2026.

Streams come and go, so read a failure with that in mind. Of 400 channels picked at random that day, 256 sent a stream. The rest were offline (404), refused outside their country (403, often marked "[Geo-blocked]") or didn't answer, and "[Not 24/7]" channels are off at times. One channel failing says little about the app; several from different hosts failing the same way is worth a look. The guide the index names covers two channels, Al Jazeera English and ANT1 Europe, a day or two ahead, so check guide changes against the fake provider. Its channels do show the tracks broadcasters declare: on 5 October 2026, from France, Das Erste offered three sound tracks, and NHK World-Japan and NBC News NOW subtitles. The [reviewers' playlist](../maintainers/microsoft-store.md#the-reviewers-playlist) names no guide, so its Guide row reads "none in this playlist"; of its five channels, DW English and ABC News (Australia) carried English subtitles that day, and DW Español and DW Arabic declare English subtitles that held no lines. iptv-org has no movies or series, and no lawful public source offers them yet: on-demand checks stay on the fake provider and fake TMDB until one does.

## App measurements

`node apps/desktop/test/e2e/measure-app.ts [--runs 3] [--subscriptions 1] [--json results.json] <app executable> [-- app arguments]` drives a built app against synthetic subscriptions, each with 13,000 channels, about 2,000 with a guide, a continuous 720p stream encoded by ffmpeg and a 20-season series. `--subscriptions 2` exercises combined catalogues with colliding provider ids. Runs and subscriptions must be positive integers, bounded at 20 and 4 respectively.

The existing measures retain their names and explicit units. Readiness checks run in the renderer, near DOM mutations, with a 5 ms probe for video clocks. A picture needs a new source, nonzero width and two advancing clock observations. Rows, programme search results, the series title and 26 episode rows must appear. Stream counts cover tuning, switching and Home to Watch across all synthetic providers. These observations prove element-level media-clock readiness, not decoded frame advancement, painted frames, audible audio or disappearance of the tuning overlay. Provider counts are aggregate across subscriptions.

Every invocation calibrates known 5, 10, 20 and 50 ms delays three times with mutation observation and with the probe alone. Raw calibration distinguishes actual timer delay, observation error and setup overhead. It measures timer-to-detection latency on an idle renderer with a simple DOM predicate; it does not calibrate complex predicates under load. Keyboard actions include CDP dispatch latency. Each invocation performs one unmeasured tune and switch against the same configured workload before measured interactions; its cost and movement observations are retained separately. No measured round is discarded. Cold process starts include launching and attaching CDP, with a 5 ms attachment probe; they reuse the populated profile and disk cache. This is not an empty-profile first login or a cold OS cache.

Without `--json`, raw results go to `.local/measurements/app-<time>.json`. Each result retains every sample, workload, cache/warmup conditions, host load/CPU/platform, Node/Electron/FFmpeg versions, source revision/dirty state and built main hash. Pass `--revision <sha>` for a supplied build. Packaged builds without it report revision `unavailable`; the measuring checkout cannot identify their source. Checkout revision means measuring HEAD and requires a matching rebuild. `sourceDirty` describes the measuring checkout, with that scope recorded; it is `unknown` if Git cannot report the state. `ffmpeg` is retained as a compatibility alias for `fixtureFfmpeg`, the encoder on PATH or the explicit override; `playerFfmpeg` records the bundled player binary when discoverable, otherwise `unavailable`. App version is recorded for checkout builds and is unavailable for packages without known metadata. Built-checkout hashes identify the main bundle; packaged measurements hash the supplied executable. Neither hash alone identifies every renderer/resource file. The first measured picture also has a PNG and accessibility tree beside the JSON. The legacy `installed size (MB)` key is preserved for consumers, but checkout measurements explicitly label it `electron-runtime-folder only`, excluding app output and assets. It is not installed app size. Packaged measurements sum the app bundle or containing folder. MB now means exactly 1,000,000 bytes, not the old rounded MiB; historical values require conversion. Build mode and size scope must match across comparisons.

`node apps/desktop/test/e2e/compare-builds.ts [--rounds 5] [--runs 3] [--subscriptions 1] [--output .local/measurements/comparison] <baseline> <candidate> [-- app arguments]` records one login-readiness warmup per build, then alternates their order. Every measured invocation additionally performs the workload tune/switch warmup described above. `--baseline-revision` and `--candidate-revision` record supplied build revisions. Keep baseline/candidate app arguments equivalent; separate packaged executables are the normal before/after use. The default five rounds use the shared minimum sample count so single-sample metrics can reach an adequate comparison. Explicit one-, two- and three-round diagnostics remain valid, with an inconclusive or warning verdict and an insufficient-samples marker. `--help` prints the defaults. For an unchanged checkout self comparison on Linux, use five alternating rounds with one run and two subscriptions:

```sh
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/compare-builds.ts --rounds 5 --runs 1 --subscriptions 2 --output .local/measurements/comparison apps/desktop/node_modules/electron/dist/electron apps/desktop/node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

The retained Linux/Xvfb capture with those arguments cost 538.8 seconds wall time. That is an observed cost on that host, not a budget or native-platform result. A pass means no separated slowdown in those samples, not statistical confidence. The built-checkout directory is identified by its `out/main/index.js`, independently of flag order after `--`; trailing flags such as `--use-mock-keychain` do not change the recorded build mode, hash or size scope.

Raw rounds and `comparison.json` remain in the output directory, including completed rounds after failure. The structured comparison reports sample counts, min/max spread, medians, absolute and relative deltas. A zero baseline has no relative percentage. Names, units, sample counts, workloads and conditions must match. Platform, CPU model/count, Node, Electron, fixture encoder and build mode must also match. The CLI checks the first baseline/candidate pair before starting later rounds, retaining raw files and diagnostics on mismatch. Requiring matching Electron intentionally excludes comparisons across an Electron upgrade, even when that upgrade is a legitimate product change; a broader runtime policy is outside this tool's current scope. Actual source revisions and build hashes may differ; both environment identities and hash equality are retained in the comparison. Missing/empty/non-finite samples or failed readiness are invalid instrumentation and exit nonzero. Performance warnings exit zero. Timing/size warnings require a median increase over 10% and separated observed ranges: the candidate minimum must exceed the baseline maximum by the observation floor. The timing floor is the largest of 20 ms, configured resolution and twice the worst measured observation error; size uses 10 MB. Count warnings require a candidate minimum above the baseline maximum and a positive median delta. A constant increase of exactly one still warns, including at large counts. Range gap, within-build spread, sample counts and the observation floor are separate fields. Fewer than five pooled samples per side is marked `insufficientSamples` in each metric, the top-level JSON and the table. Valid instrumentation has a separate measured verdict: `warning` if any observed regression crosses its rule, `inconclusive` if no warning appears but any metric is undersampled, otherwise `pass`. An undersampled warning keeps the insufficiency marker. Five is a conservative heuristic, not statistical confidence or a guaranteed false-alarm rate. This conservative policy retains outliers and loses sensitivity on variable workloads; a pass means no separated slowdown observed, not equivalence or statistical confidence. Repeat warnings on the same host before calling them regressions.

Retained same-hash captures at `--runs 1 --subscriptions 2` produced tune counts of 2 in all six three-round self invocations and 1 in a subsequent targeted invocation under matching conditions. The cause is unproven. Counts remain raw; this contrary sample prevents a claim that tune counts are repeatable. Overlapping observed ranges suppress warnings, while separated constant counts still warn.

A review simulation gave about 25% report warnings at three samples per side under independent 15% noise across eight timing metrics. That is an assumed-noise simulation, not an observed product false-alarm rate or a calibrated guarantee. Range overlap can hide real slowdowns.

Recheck one retained baseline/candidate pair without launching apps. This command does not reproduce the pooled five-round comparison. With one sample per side for some metrics it remains undersampled and may report an inconclusive or warning verdict:

```sh
node apps/desktop/test/e2e/compare-builds.ts --baseline-json .local/measurements/comparison/baseline-1.json --candidate-json .local/measurements/comparison/candidate-1.json --output .local/measurements/recheck
```

## Guide budgets

`node --expose-gc apps/desktop/scripts/measure-guide.ts [--subscriptions 1] [--json results.json]` generates a 1,300-channel, 70-programme guide for each 13,000-channel subscription. It measures service refresh/indexing, event-loop delay with a 5 ms monitor, disk reload, a 60-channel screen shared across subscriptions, programme searches and manual mapping. `--file .local/guide.xml` uses a local XMLTV document. `--guide-channels` and `--programmes` must be positive integers within the guide limits. Generated guides are bounded to 500,000 total programmes per subscription. Memory measurement requires `--expose-gc`. Every CLI prepares and checks the actual JSON destination before expensive work, including nested missing directories.

Raw operation samples, environment, document size and explicit budget outcomes go to `.local/measurements/guide-<time>.json` by default. The aggregate download/index time is unbudgeted; each subscription refresh is retained as a separate readiness sample and must stay below 3,000 ms, event-loop delay below 50 ms, every measured screen listing below 5 ms, and aggregate retained guide heap for all loaded subscriptions below 80 decimal MB. Heap is measured before releasing the first service. Before cached reads, the first runtime is disposed, its wrapper is proven collected, and GC runs outside the timed phase. Cached reads measure a fresh service in the same process with warm OS caches, not a fresh-process restart. The existing restart metric key is retained for consumers, with its scope recorded. Exceeded budgets are warnings; empty synthetic search/mapping results or invalid samples fail instrumentation. Local XMLTV files may legitimately contain no news; only document loading is required for those search checks. Unbudgeted operations say `not-configured`.

The parser limits in `packages/core/src/guide/limits.ts` still apply. Provider guides stay in ignored `.local/`. Synthetic inputs are the release workload and comparison results depend on the machine.

## Viewing record

`node apps/desktop/scripts/measure-viewing.ts [--events 100000] [--subscriptions 1] [--json results.json]` fills a temporary database with deterministic synthetic history across the requested subscriptions. Events must be a positive integer no larger than 1,000,000. It retains 1,000 watch/favourite commit samples, database open/rebuild timings, 200 favourite moves, event counts and exact rebuild checks. Raw results default to `.local/measurements/viewing-<time>.json`. This tool has no absolute timing budgets; its structured conditions state that policy. A rebuild mismatch fails instrumentation.

## Targeted release measurements

On a release candidate, run the following serially on one host, alongside the installed functional checks. Retain each command's wall time and host load with its raw output. This bounded workload exercises two subscriptions with 10,000 viewing-history inputs once without running the full multi-build benchmark on every pull request:

```sh
node --expose-gc apps/desktop/scripts/measure-guide.ts --subscriptions 2
node apps/desktop/scripts/measure-viewing.ts --events 10000 --subscriptions 2
xvfb-run -a node apps/desktop/test/e2e/measure-app.ts --runs 1 --subscriptions 2 apps/desktop/node_modules/electron/dist/electron -- --no-sandbox "$PWD/apps/desktop"
```

Use the platform's normal display and mock keychain arguments on macOS. For changes to instrumentation, calibrate and self-compare the same unchanged build for one fixed five-round alternating capture, with `--runs 1 --subscriptions 2`. For changes that may affect speed, run the normal repeated before/after comparison manually. CI's ordinary public-contract suite checks the result schema and CLI failure/warning behavior; full app comparisons remain outside the per-PR jobs. Report measured release-check cost from that host, rather than treating it as a fixed budget for other machines.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and push to `main`, in two jobs:

- **Check:** unused files, exports and dependencies (`pnpm knip`), lint (`pnpm lint`), format, typecheck and the production build.
- **Test:** installs Ubuntu's complete ffmpeg and ffprobe (`apps/desktop/scripts/ci-ffmpeg.sh` fails unless both run and their codecs are there), runs the suite with Vitest's JSON reporter, keeps the report and checks it.

The [release workflow](../maintainers/releasing.md) runs both jobs on the exact commit it releases, next to the packaged-app test on every installed package. CI needs no secrets, so pull requests from forks run it too.

### The test report

`scripts/ci-test-results.ts` finds the test files with `test/suites.ts`, as Vitest does, and fails unless each one is in the report once, with at least one test, every test passed. A media group that skipped for want of ffmpeg fails it, and so do a file that failed to load, a hook that failed after its tests passed, and a test file the run left out. A new test file is required as soon as it exists. The one exception is `apps/desktop/test/airplay-helper-key.test.ts`, which runs only on macOS: elsewhere its tests may skip, but it still has to be in the report with none failed. To hold a local run to the same rule:

```sh
pnpm test --reporter=default --reporter=json --outputFile.json="$PWD/.local/test-results.json"
node scripts/ci-test-results.ts .local/test-results.json
```

Run it from the repository's root. Without ffmpeg the media files fail it, and on Windows so do the files that skip there: the rule is CI's, on Linux.

The Test job uploads the report as the artifact `test-results-<run id>-<attempt>`, kept seven days, whether or not the tests passed. Release runs name it `test-results-<version>-<attempt>`, so a stable run's nightly first and stable release keep a report each. The report's paths are the runner's, so read a downloaded one with `jq` rather than the check:

```sh
gh run download <run id> -n test-results-<run id>-<attempt> -D .local/ci-report
jq -r '.testResults[] | select(.status != "passed") | .name, .message' .local/ci-report/test-results.json
jq -r '.testResults[] | "\(.endTime - .startTime | floor) ms \(.name)"' .local/ci-report/test-results.json | sort -rn | head
```

Files run in parallel, so their times overlap and don't add up to the job's. When no report was written, the tests never ran: the upload warns that it found no file, and the check fails on the missing report.

A release checks out the source it builds under the workflows of the commit the run started from, main's. A stable release can promote a tested nightly from before `scripts/ci-test-results.ts`. For such a source the step runs the `apps/desktop/scripts/ci-multimedia-results.ts` it has instead, which requires its seven multimedia files and no others, and a source with neither script fails. Keep that branch while a tested nightly that old can still be promoted; `test/release-workflow.test.ts` runs the step on both layouts.

`.github/workflows/marketing.yml` builds the website on every pull request and push to `main`, also without secrets, installing only what `apps/marketing` declares. It is apart from CI, so a page that doesn't build never holds back an app release. `.github/workflows/marketing-deploy.yml` publishes the page from `main`; [the website's README](../../apps/marketing/README.md#how-it-gets-published) describes it.
