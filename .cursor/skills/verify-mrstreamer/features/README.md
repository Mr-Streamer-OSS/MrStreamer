# Feature map

Source of truth for desktop and website verification paths. Run the relevant baseline, then cover the changed path's other entry points. Desktop helpers start a fresh app with fake IPTV/TMDB; the website helper starts a local build and isolated browser. Profiles and ports are owned by that run, and proof remains in gitignored `.local/verification/` after cleanup.

| [Watchlist](watchlist.md)         | `watchlist`           | Toggle removal, Home entry, restart persistence, keyboard, unavailable titles                   |

For desktop checks, use `pnpm verify:desktop doctor` first; the website helper performs its own live doctor. After a surprising result inspect retained proof and start a new owned session. PNGs and accessibility trees show the before/after state; `proof.json` records actions and observable side effects. A skipped entry point is a reported coverage gap. Passing one baseline never proves every path in a row. Installed packaging, updates, real provider services, hardware/audio output and receivers need their documented native checks. For native macOS behavior use the installed `mac-mini` skill and the parent skill's Mac recipes. Linux evidence is not macOS acceptance.
