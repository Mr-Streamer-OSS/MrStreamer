# Marketing website

## Sub-features

Home and system-specific download buttons, the full download page, six user guides, release history, About, Security and Privacy. Responsive layout and route/metadata correctness are part of the website contract.

## How to get to it (user POV)

Open Home. **Guides** opens `/docs`; select **Subscriptions** or another guide. **Downloads** opens `/download`, with verified installer links and requirements. Footer links open **Releases**, **Privacy**, **About** and **Security**. The homepage's hero button depends on the visitor's system; its Downloads link scrolls to the complete list. Unknown addresses show a 404.

## Driving it with browser/CDP

Preconditions: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then `pnpm build:marketing`. Build assets and route/link checks are local output only. The build may read public GitHub release metadata and installer headers; it does not deploy the site or download installers.

For interactive verification, use T3 collaborative preview first. Run the repo's `pnpm preview:marketing` with an unused loopback port and `--strictPort`, open that owned local URL, inspect a snapshot and click its semantic link handles. Capture Home, the changed route and the relevant narrow viewport. Verify actual link destinations, canonical/title metadata and status codes alongside the rendered page. Stop only the server you started. Do not attach to or deploy the production website.

When collaborative preview is absent or reports browser setup unavailable, run `pnpm verify:website`, or `xvfb-run -a pnpm verify:website` on headless Linux. This complete baseline session owns a Vite preview, isolated Electron browser and profile. It records real pointer navigation from Home through Guides, Subscriptions, Downloads, Releases and Privacy, paired screenshots/accessibility trees and route metadata. Keep the full navigation flow at 390px without horizontal overflow. Require known routes to answer 200 and an unknown route to answer 404. Check all four displayed installer destinations or their GitHub Releases fallback and the Microsoft Store product; the helper inspects links without following them. Its live doctor checks browser and server identity before driving and after each navigation. The helper captures after navigation or scrolling; an unchanged viewport reuses its preceding capture, named in the before-click proof. Captures wait for fonts, finite animations and rendering to settle; visually inspect them before accepting the proof. All proof remains in `.local/verification/website-<unique>/` after both processes and scratch state are removed.

The existing `apps/marketing/test/` suites verify OS detection, link/feed fallback, page rendering and release-history contracts. Run those for changes to those behaviors. The baseline alone does not exercise Windows/Mac user-agent variants, all six guides, About/Security, live feed refresh, no-script mode or Safari. Use the installed `mac-mini` skill's control tools for native Safari checks on the Mac mini, recording the real browser and viewport.

Source: `apps/marketing/README.md`, `apps/marketing/scripts/pages.ts`, `apps/marketing/src/downloads.ts`, `apps/marketing/src/system.ts`, `apps/marketing/vite.config.ts` and `apps/marketing/test/`.

## Gotchas

Build-time release history can fall back to truthful GitHub links when unavailable. The isolated baseline browser blocks external requests, so it proves the built fallback/links, not successful live refresh, production analytics or installer downloads. Record what was observed rather than calling all network behavior verified. A 390px desktop-browser viewport is responsive evidence, not a physical-phone or Safari check. Native OS download choices require the matching user agent. Prefer the current page registry to guessing route aliases.
